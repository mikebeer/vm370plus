# VM/370plus — where things stand

Last updated **11 October 2026, 08:00 UTC**. **Read this first in a new session.**

**The milestone plan of record is `docs/60-MILESTONES.md`** (from the owner's `docs/VM370PLUS-Milestones.xlsx`, adopted 11 October): M9 = the work before 64-bit (9.1-9.12, ending with kit build 7 and the firewall guest), M10 = 64-bit (with migration documentation and kit 8), M11 = after 64-bit (MP, more languages, VoIP, IoT, containers, CFSERV, kit 9). Where this file says "M9" for 64-bit, read M10.

## Current position, 10 October evening -- kit build 6

**14 Oct, 00:30 (run rx1): RXPIP bridge refreshed in the Debian guest.** /opt/rxpip server, client and examples from rexxpository main (7f39c24); handler with `install --global` and `RXPIP_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`; minicurl takes `--connect-timeout` (the new client sends it; the Regina CGI answers in ~45 s, so it only lengthens the timeout). Verified from CMS: `RXPIP RUN DEMO`, `RXPIP GET STRUTILS`, `RXPIP SEARCH UTIL`; no `.rxpip` directory in the service's working directory.

**Delivered (14 Oct, 05:25): kit build 14**, `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261014-b14-part1..16.zip` (403 MB). The Debian disk is the 3390-9 (6.8 GB, 5.8 GB free), shipped with its free blocks zeroed by `tools/cckdzero.py` (245 MB); PostgreSQL 16 + PGSQL, MQ, the rxpip refresh, CP fixes for CTC guests (I-287: scheduler, high frames). Verified on a fresh CE (kt28): Debian boots from the joined disk, PostgreSQL runs, `LANG` has PGSQL, CMSUSER CREATE/INSERT/SELECT through PGSQL. Found I-288 (a disconnected Linux guest freezes in console wait).

**Delivered (13 Oct, 22:40): kit build 13**, `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261013-b13-part1..18.zip`. Adds NICOF for IPL 290 built with GCC 13 on the language disk (CMSFTP31, NHFS31, HACC31, IPLOOK31, HTTPD31, NCTEST; nicof/gcc13), the fixes I-285 (NICOF under IPL 290) and I-286 (HX under IPL 290: DMSITSR's base registers). Verified on a fresh CE (kt27): AUTOLOG1 + nicof.sh, HTTPD31 file list of A, CMSFTP31 with ftplib (NLST, LIST 270 files, STOR/RETR text), NHFS31 PUT, NCTEST, IPLOOK31 -ME, HX of HTTPD31 then Q DISK. The rxpip handler changes went into the working Debian disk on 14 Oct (run rx1, see below); kit 13 still has the old handler.

**Delivered (13 Oct, 16:40): kit build 12**, `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261013-b12-part1..18.zip`. Adds CP/M 2.2 (9.33): RUNCPM MODULE + CPM EXEC + the CP/M programs on the language disk (drive L:), `runcpm` and the `cpm` bridge service in Debian. Verified on a fresh CE (kt26): CMSUSER 64M, IPL 290, LANG, `CPM IMPORT HELLO ASM`, `CPM L:ASM HELLO; L:LOAD HELLO; HELLO` prints its line; `CPM DIR *.COM; STAT (LINUX` from CMS.

**Delivered (13 Oct, 15:10): kit build 11**, `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261013-b11-part1..18.zip`. Adds TELL to the internet (9.32: `TELL user AT NET`, MQTT gateway, logins + ACL, `netfwd.py --tls`, `nettell.py`), NICOF (9.13d: sockets, CMSFTPD, NHFS; PC side `vm370plus/nicof`) and the CP fix I-283 (STNSM/STOSM in BC mode). Verified on a fresh CE (kt25): AUTOLOG1 started the NICOF proxies and the Java proxies connected; `NHFS LIST` saw a PC file; CMSFTPD listed the disks to ftplib; `tellnet-user alice`, then alice -> CMSUSER and `TELL alice AT NET` -> alice.

**Delivered (13 Oct, 13:35): kit build 10**, `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261013-b10-part1..18.zip`. Adds TELL (9.14: CMS TELL EXEC, `TELL user AT LINUX`, Linux `tell` + setuid `vmmsg`), the fix of I-277 (CE's GCCLIB segment re-saved from the current GCCLIB TEXT) and the bridge/document EXECs on MAINT 19D. Verified on a fresh CE (kt24): CMSUSER at 8M with the GCCLIB segment, `TELL` with 11 arguments; `TELL root AT LINUX` shown on root's terminals, `tell cmsuser` back.

**Delivered (13 Oct, 12:15): kit build 9**, `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261013-b9-part1..18.zip`. Adds the spool bridge (vmspoold; LXCALL, PHONE, MQTT, RXPIP), documents and printing (TROFF, BOOKIE with the vmplus style, LATEX, Ghostscript, PSPRINT + tools/psprint.py) and Linux kernel #10. Verified on a fresh CE V1R1.2 (kt22): LXCALL SYS, BOOKIE SAMPLE (PS, LATEX HELLO, PSPRINT -> PDF. Parts 1-5 rebuilt 12:30 with the bridge and document EXECs also on MAINT 19D (they work under `ipl cms`; kt23 checked; 19D is now 99% full, 75 blocks left). Notes: LANG (samples, compilers) needs IPL 290 (EDF); on a fresh system the real printer 00E is drained (`START 00E`).

**Delivered (12 Oct, 20:35): kit build 8**, `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261012-b8-part1..15.zip`. It adds the language disk VMLANG (MAINT 19F; parts 14-15 with JOINLANG): GCC 13 C/C++, GnuCOBOL, COBX, PL/I, Python, SQLite + SQLSERV, Pascal, APL, xBase and Smalltalk on CMS, and `LANG` EXEC. AUTOLOG1 attaches the volume at IPL. Debian carries APL, COBOL, PL/I, xBase C and Smalltalk C.

Verified on a fresh CE (kt17-kt21):
- VMLANG is CP SYSTEM after IPL, and `LANG` accesses it as L.
- SQLite `select 6*7` gives 42|3.46.1.
- `CC HI` compiles natively and HI prints `Hi!`.
- The Debian login works.

**Delivered (11 Oct, 20:55):** `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261011-b7-part1..13.zip`. It adds:
- EDF (larger minidisks) under IPL 290.
- Warm start.
- TDISK.
- Per-user Linux IP.
- The Guide.

Verified on a fresh CE (kt16):
- CMSUSER: IPL 290 loads DMSEFS. FORMAT (BLKSIZE 4096 works on a T3350, and so do COPYFILE, re-ACCESS, QUERY DISK and TDISK.
- MAINT: QUERY SET, then `cp ipl linux` reaches the Debian login, then root, uname and poweroff.

**Delivered:** `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261010-b6-part1..12.zip` (parts under 30 MB; the Debian disk, a 3390-9, in parts 6-12 with JOINDEB.CMD / joindeb.sh) and the Guide (Chapter 6, Service Machines). Verified on a fresh CE (kt15): QUERY SET, AUTOLOG CHATBOT + CHAT from CMSUSER, `cp ipl linux` to the Debian login on the 3390-9, poweroff, shutdown.

## Current position, 9 October — kit build 5: Linux (Debian 7.11) for several users, from CMS, side by side with CMS users; the VM/370plus Guide

**Delivered:** `dist/VM370PLUS-kit-20261009-b5-part1..7.zip`, which goes over a fresh CE V1R1.2 with MAINSIZE 256, and
`arch/31bit/manual/VM370PLUS-Guide.docx`, a 20-page IBM-style guide (`mkguide.sh`).
To run Linux: log on to MAINT, `CP DEF STOR 64M`, `IPL CMS`, `LINUX`.
The kit was verified on a fresh CE (kt14).

**Milestones**

| | |
|---|---|
| M1–M5a, M5b nucleus | done: CP ESA/390, AMODE 31, 31-bit guests, paging, CMS rebuilt from source |
| M7.1–M7.7 | done: ESA/390 guests with DAT (DMKVAX shadow tables), the Linux 4.0 31-bit kernel, BusyBox, Debian 7.11 from a 3390 with SSH over CTC |
| **M7.8** | **done**: LINUX EXEC on MAINT 19D, a parameter file per user, `SET ESA ON` pending until the next device IPL, CMS first and then Linux, Linux and CMS users side by side (`M7.8-MULTIUSER.md`, tests `m7-linux-cms-coexist*`) |
| Guide | done (b5) |
| **now: M8.2** | the current cREXX built natively on CMS: RXC82 and RXAS82 work on CMS; RXBVM82 being fixed (`41-M8.2-NATIVE-CREXX.md`) |
| Debian session | Python 2.7/3.2, cREXX for Linux, Prolog and LOGO under Debian (gcc 4.6.3 already installed) |
| **M7.10 (done 10 Oct)** | `IPL LINUX`: the Debian disk at virtual 250 IPLs as an ESA/390 machine (`CP IPL LINUX` = SET ESA ON + IPL 250; also from a directory IPL statement). `linux390/debian/vmzipl` writes the kernel and the CDL IPL records (IPL1/IPL2 with their keys, I-255); DMKCCW keeps DEDDTBL while DMKVMI runs the IPL; DMKCFG puts DMKVMI at X'FFF000'. LINUX EXEC: `LINUX` IPLs the disk, `LINUX READER` the old reader route. Verified zp18: boot from disk in ~7 min, Asterisk starts at boot. Note: DMKCFG is pageable and now 4090 of 4096 bytes -- any further change there must move code out first |
| **M7.9 (done 10 Oct)** | CVTCHN converts format-1 chains of any length: what is done is kept as segments (first, last CCW), one per TIC target (up to 32), not as 64 single CCWs. Verified zp20: Debian with max_sectors_kb 760 (writes averaging 56 blocks a request), 21 MB and 40 MB files read back identical, no DASD errors. The initramfs still sets 128 KB; raise it with the next kernel/initramfs |
| **M7.11 (done 10 Oct)** | the Debian disk is a 3390-9 (real 192, `disks/lnx192.cckd`, 7 GB, 6.8 GB root with 5.9 GB free): fdasd + mkfs.ext2 + a copy of golden8 + `vmzipl -r` (zp19, 31 min); IPL LINUX from it verified (zp20). Golden9 = `lnx192.golden9.cckd` |
| M4b.3 | CP using real frames above 16 MB; needed for two Debians at once (I-254) |
| CP leftovers | I-235 models, I-201 DMKDMP dump, the LPSW fast path for PSWs above 16 MB |
| gcc under Debian | done: gcc 4.6.3, g++, make |
| CPWATCH | get it running again (I-251) |
| M6 | 31-bit CMS proper, including larger minidisks (4K blocks, past the 65,535-block limit of the 800-byte format) |
| **Before M9 (owner, 10 Oct)** | C++ on CMS (subset via the cross route; full after M9), SQL (SQLite on CMS; MariaDB/PostgreSQL on Debian), CMS sockets + httpd, xBase/Harbour, MQ -- then a **distributable snapshot (kit)** |
| M9 | 64-bit |
| After M9 | MP (CP on several CPUs, then virtual MP for guests); GNU APL (Debian, needs a newer C++); full C++; CFSERV (a coupling service machine, owner OK 10 Oct) |

**Backlog (agreed, not scheduled before M9 unless said):**
- Languages in cREXX, for CMS (via RXBVM8, later RXBVM82) and Linux, built by `arch/31bit/languages/mklangs.sh` with a cREXX `rxfloat` (`languages/common`): BASIC (mikebeer/basic, 13/13 tests), SNOBOL4 (mikebeer/snobol, 10/10), Pascal (mikebeer/pascal, 11/11), Lisp (mikebeer/lisp, 12/12), Prolog, LOGO -- all pass on the PC, and run on CMS through RXBVM8 (run lg2; `mkcmsdeck.py`). Smalltalk (mikebeer/smalltalk, 10/10) and PL/M (mikebeer/PLM) added 10 Oct; each language builds in its own directory; on Debian (golden6 disk) all run. Others: FORTH (pforth); MicroPython on CMS, CPython on 64-bit CMS after M9; R under Debian; a modern APL (GNU APL checked); bwBASIC, and CE's own BASIC checked; FreeBASIC after M9; a PL/M compiler (PL/M to C).
- **Languages on CMS verified 10 Oct** (runs lg4-lg7, CMSUSER 196): BASIC, SNOBOL, Pascal, Lisp, PL/M (hello, sieve), Smalltalk (hello, fib; needs MAINSIZE 256: with 16 MB real storage it pages to a crawl), Turbo CREXX (hello, fibfact). Fixes: cmsrt gives main an 8 MB stack from the heap (the 64 KB BSS stack crashed RXAS8), heap up to 232 MB, an out-of-storage message, names cut to 8; reader decks are now loaded one at a time (Hercules refuses DEVINIT while the reader is busy).
- Turbo CREXX (the project owner's turbocrexx-cli, a Turbo-Pascal-style menu around cREXX): on Debian in the bundle (`turbocrexx`, with a small s390 `crexx` driver, `languages/turbo/crexx`; verified on Debian 10 Oct); on CMS as `TURBO EXEC` (EDIT + RXC8/RXAS8/RXBVM8), in the LANGS deck (run lg3).
- THE (The Hessling Editor) 3.3 and Regina REXX 3.6: **installed on Debian** 10 Oct from the wheezy packages (the owner downloaded them with `linux390/pc/get-wheezy-the.bat`; golden7 disk). THE on CMS after the 3270 panel library.
- xBase: mikebeer/xbase (cREXX, when it has commits) on both; Harbour on Debian first, CMS later.
- MQTT (mikebeer/mqtt): on CMS and Debian, alongside MQ.
- Telephony: Asterisk 1.8 on Debian as an experiment -- **installed and running 10 Oct (golden8: Asterisk 1.8.13.1, SIP on UDP 5060)** (before M9; `linux390/pc/get-wheezy.bat` fetches it); FreeSWITCH and audio/video conferencing after M9. Not on CMS (threads, sockets, real-time timers).
- AI gateway service machine (before M9): a Linux guest relaying to an LLM on the PC or a cloud API; Linux guests over HTTP, CMS users through spool (an ASK EXEC to the gateway's reader; answers by CP MSG or reader file, Linux side via vmur/DIAG 14 and vmcp/DIAG 8). A local LLM only after M9 (s390x), and slow under emulation.
- The owner's chatbot (CHATBOT b1, received 10 Oct): the MCchat persona bot in cREXX as a CMS service machine CHATBOT -- questions punched to its reader, answers punched back to the sender (ORIGINID); CHAT EXEC as the client. Next after M7.11/M7.9.
- IoT: mosquitto (MQTT broker, Debian) -- **1.6.15 static installed 10 Oct (golden8; pub/sub on 1883 verified)** -- before M9 with mikebeer/mqtt; Node-RED after M9 (Node.js has no 31-bit s390 port).
- APL in C (mikebeer/apl v0.4): **before M9; under way** -- PC 34/34, Debian (31-bit static, `languages/apl/mkapl.sh`) 34/34; CMS APL MODULE cross-built (M5f, with new setjmp/longjmp in the runtime), CMS run pending -- Debian natively (gcc 4.6) or cross-built, CMS through the M8.1 cross route (GCC 13 -m31, newlib, cmsrt) like cREXX; the APL glyphs need a transliteration or an APL code page on the 3270/3215 (UTF-8 over SSH on Debian is fine).
- Smalltalk (owner, 10 Oct): a faster C implementation exists alongside the cREXX one; both go in, but only after networking (CMS sockets; the C version has no networking yet), and then the sources are updated from upstream.
- APL: `apl.rexx` (cREXX) to be ignored until the owner says it is complete; APL\360 as a VM guest is a possible historic route.
- Name: the project is **VM/370plus** (was VM/370plus) -- docs, guide, kit, EXECs and CP's logon banner.
- Message queueing (mikebeer/mq): on Linux a statically linked client with a RabbitMQ broker; on CMS a VM-native queue machine over VMCF/IUCV, a RabbitMQ client after CMS sockets.
- C++ on CMS: OK from the owner (10 Oct): a subset through the cross route before M9, full C++ after M9.
- Service machines (proposed 10 Oct): SQLSERV (SQLite in a CMS service machine owning the database minidisk; requests by spool, later VMCF/IUCV or sockets) with the SQL work before M9; ASKSERV, the AI gateway (Linux guest; CMS by spool like CHATBOT, Linux by HTTP; could back CHATBOT for questions its data cannot answer); a telephony gateway to Asterisk (CALL EXEC -> spool -> Asterisk AMI; voicemail notices by CP MSG). One request/reply protocol for all (the CHATBOT 'FROM userid' spool deck, later IUCV/sockets), with one client library for CMS and one for Linux.
- Optional network pack (owner OK 10 Oct; after M4b.3, before M9): BORDER, a Debian firewall guest owning the real CTC to the PC (iptables/NAT/port forwarding; the 4.0 kernel needs netfilter), other guests behind it on virtual CTCs (CP COUPLE); LB, an HTTP load balancer (HAProxy 1.4 or nginx) in front of web guests; SCALER, a CMS service machine (class A/B) that XAUTOLOGs or logs off web guests by load, from a pool of disks cloned from the golden disk. All optional, off by default.
- DOS and Windows as guest programs (owner OK 10 Oct): FreeDOS under a small 8086/DOS emulator (DOSBox or a minimal core) on Debian, later as a CMS command, like CP/M; **Bochs** on 31-bit Debian (g++ 4.6) for FreeDOS, then Windows 3.x/NT 4 or ReactOS as a demonstration (NT 4 under Bochs on Linux/390 was done in 2000 -- linux-390 list, msg72820), started by a CP name like IPL LINUX (`IPL WINDOWS`); **QEMU** (s390x TCG host) after M9 for ReactOS, the better route.
- QUERY SET shows ESA ON/OFF/pending (owner, 10 Oct): **done** (line 5, XA54).
- **z/VM command comparison (owner, 10 Oct)** -- what to adopt, by when (tables of what exists: `50-COMMANDS.md`, generated by `tools/cmdtables.py`):
  - done: `SET MACHINE 370|XA|ESA` and `QUERY MACHINE` (z/VM names; `SET ESA ON|OFF` stays as the synonym); FILELIST as `FULIST`/`FL`.
  - next, small: `GLOBALV` **done 11 Oct** (a nucleus extension loaded by SYSPROFX; FULIST takes EDITOR/BROWSER from group FULIST); I-257 and I-258 **done** (the REXX full-screen package, FULIST, EE and FSVIEW now run under the 290 CMS too).
  - with M4b.3: `QUERY FRAMES`, fuller `QUERY STORAGE`, `INDICATE` extensions.
  - network pack: `DEFINE CTCA` / `COUPLE` written up as the multi-guest route; DIAG X'250' (block I/O, Linux's fast DASD path) and X'210'/X'24' looked at.
  - before M9: `DEFINE MDISK` (temporary minidisks by command), `QUERY NSS`/DCSS names; XEDIT-compatible editing through THE on CMS (no XEDIT of our own); `RDRLIST`, and `NOTE`/`SENDFILE`/`RECEIVE`/`TELL` with the Office; `NUCXLOAD` family; IUCV beyond VMCF.
  - with M9: `SET MACHINE Z`, 64-bit `DISPLAY`/`STORE` (G and access registers), `TRACE` PER forms.
  - with MP: `DEFINE CPU`, `QUERY VIRTUAL CPUS`, `VARY PROCESSOR`.
  - after M9: guest LAN, `DEFINE NIC`, VSWITCH (QDIO emulation in CP); CMS Pipelines (`PIPE`); SFS.
  - not planned: RACF/ESM, `SET PRIVCLASS`, MDC.
- CFSERV (after M9): no real Coupling Facility (CFCC is IBM microcode; Hercules has no coupling links or CF instructions, and only z/OS XES uses one). Instead a service machine offering CF-like lock, list (shared queues, for MQ) and cache structures: CMS users by VMCF/IUCV-style messages or SMSG, Linux guests over TCP, other Hercules systems over CTCE or TCP.
- Docker: not on 31-bit (Docker and containerd are Go programs, and Go has no 31-bit s390 port; Docker needs a 64-bit kernel with cgroups and overlayfs). After M9, under a 64-bit Linux (s390x) guest with a current Debian, where Docker's s390x builds run. Before that, LXC containers under Debian 7 (LXC is C; the Linux 4.0 kernel has namespaces and cgroups) as a first step.
- SMAPI (the z/VM Systems Management API): a VSMSERVE-style service virtual machine in REXX/cREXX that answers a subset of the SMAPI calls (Image_Query, Image_Activate/Deactivate, Image_Create/Delete through the directory, Image_Disk_Create/Delete, Virtual_Network queries) using class A/B CP commands and the directory program; locally over VMCF/IUCV, and over TCP (port 44444, the SMAPI wire format) after CMS sockets; an smcli-style client for Debian. Lets OpenStack-era tools (Feilong/zVM Cloud Connector) and scripts manage VM/370plus guests.
- ooRexx (owner OK 10 Oct): ooRexx 5.x on Debian before M9, cross-built statically with the s390 toolchain (g++ 13 -m31, glibc sysroot) like cREXX for Linux; on CMS only after C++ on CMS (needs a full C++ runtime and threads), realistically after M9.
- NetRexx (owner 14 Oct: on Linux AND CMS): milestones 9.34 (Debian) and 9.35 (CMS). No OpenJDK is reachable (archive.debian.org blocked), so the Java VM is JamVM + GNU Classpath from GitHub mirrors (xranby/jamvm, gnu-mirror-unofficial/classpath): C parts cross-built (wcc for Debian, GCC 13 cmsrt for CMS, single-threaded), Java parts and NetRexx (RexxLA/netrexx) built on the PC with javac -source/-target 8. NetRexx interpreted (-exec) first, compiling (needs a Java compiler on the guest: ecj) second.
- Java: OpenJDK 7 under Debian (soon, a package download like Python); a fuller Java on CMS after M9.
- SQL: SQLite on CMS (cross-built like M8.1, with a CMS file layer and a REXX interface); MariaDB/MySQL 5.5 or PostgreSQL 9.1 under Debian.
- CMS sockets (over the Hercules TCP/IP instruction) and a web server (httpd) on CMS; Apache under Debian. The Office's internet mail and web client build on these.
- CP/M 2.2 as a guest (from ivop/cpm22-from-source, needs PL/M): an 8080 emulator first under Linux, then as a CMS command, then stand-alone IPLable.
- 3270 full-screen panel library for CMS (cREXX and C); a 3270 console for Linux.
- A VisiCalc-style spreadsheet of our own for CMS, on the 3270 panel library (geoffmoss0/VisiCalc has no licence, so it is a model only).
- VM/370plus Office, PROFS-style, in REXX/cREXX: mail with internet e-mail to other users, calendar, notes, documents, a Projects module, an optional web-browser client.
- A BookMaster-compatible layer for Waterloo SCRIPT.

**Open issues that matter:** I-254 (two Debians, real storage), I-253 (SPOOL TO SYSTEM, cosmetic), I-251 (CPWATCH, worked around), I-235 models, I-201.

**CP changes since kit b4 (XA0054DK):**
- the DMKCCW 24-bit masks (I/O above 64 MB);
- PSWCKSUB tests bits 33–39 only in AMODE 24;
- DMKDSP zeroes CR3/CR7/CR13 for S/370 guests;
- the DMKCFS pending `SET ESA`;
- DMKCFG/DMKDEH release the shared system;
- DMKVAX per-user DATBLK work fields;
- DMKVCS VCSLOCK.

---

## Earlier position, 6 October (kept)
CP runs AMODE 31, hosts a 31-bit guest and pages; CMS is rebuilt from source, runs in EC mode and IPLs from 290 (M5a, M5b nucleus; SNAP-I249); a 32M machine stores and displays above 16 MB from the console (install point SNAP-I231)

Hercules 3.13, `ARCHMODE ESA/390`, the converted CP IPLed from 6A1. MAINT logs
on (`LOGON MAINT CPCMS NOIPL`), `DEF STOR 16M`, `IPL 190`: CMS loads from the
system disk, accesses its minidisks through CP's SSCH path, runs its profile,
takes a typed command and answers it from the file system.

### The night's walls, in order — all measured, none guessed

| Wall | What it was | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 23 | CE's five `HDK` modules were never reassembled; `HDKD8C`'s work area sat under our ORB, so `enable all` branched into a channel program | **closed** `I-194` |
| 24 | `DMKCFG SHRSLOOP` indexed the ESA/390 segment table with `DMKSNT`'s 64 KB segment numbers → `FRE013` on the directory's auto-`IPL CMS` | **closed** `I-195` — named systems shared by frame (XA0045DK: model tables, per-user copies, locked SYSTEM frames); `IPL CMS` works for two concurrent users, M3c reached |
| 25 | `DMKPTRAN SEGEXA` built 16-page tables for 1 MB segments (PTL 0) → `RPA001` at 128 KB | **closed** `I-196` |
| 26 | `SIO`/`TIO`/`SSK`… are *operation* exceptions on ESA/390, not privileged-op; DMKPRV reflected them | **closed** `I-199` |
| 27 | DMKPRV's key simulation located the swap entry with 64 KB geometry and stored guest keys into the I/O new PSW → `PRG006` | **closed** `I-200` |
| 28 | DMKPRV SEGOK (XA0036DK) computed the STO in R6, the guest address the two LRAs need → ISK/SSK worked the wrong frame → `DMSITP141T` in DMSREX; REXX dead | **closed** `I-202` — profile completes, REXX runs |
| 24b | DCSS in the same megabyte (GCCLIB, 13-of-16-page group): LOADSYS via the same model/copy path; DMKBLD keeps a full table and lets SWPSHR copies go | **closed** `I-214`, `I-215` — CE's complete init (AUTOLOG1 → CPWATCH, CMSBATCH, WAKEUP) runs |
| 30 | **Virtual storage above 16 MB (I-208, M2 first step).** CP runs AMODE 24, so `LRA` and DMKPTRAN saw every guest address modulo 16 MB. Seven findings on the way (I-216 – I-223): the inline `BSM` wrapper cost DMKMON its literal pool → a stub in the PSA; `N R1,=X'7FFFFFFF'` before ENTER read a literal off the caller's R10; CP's callers hand TRANS CCW/CAW words with byte 0 in use, so a 24-bit guest's addresses are rightly masked and only `OPT=AMODE31` callers (console STORE/DISPLAY, DMKPGS's release walk) are 31-bit; the flag test must follow ENTER; DMKBLDRT's `F4095` end-page mask built 16-entry segment tables; SAVEWRK9's byte 0 is a switch. | **closed** w62/w63 5 Oct 01:55 — `st s1ff0000 deadbeef` lands at 1FF0000 only, IPL CMS/LOGOFF/SHUTDOWN clean, GCCLIB regression unchanged. SNAP-I231. |
| 29 | DMKPGS CKSEG's end-of-segment test was off by one page (XA0036DK); the release loop ran off every page/swap table into free storage → `PGT005` at LOGOFF and at `DEF STOR` after IPL | **closed** `I-206` |
| 32 | **A guest in 31-bit mode (M2 step 3).** The mode had to be a maintained VMBLOK flag, not a test of PSW bit 32: CMS runs BC mode, where that bit is ILC, and the first cut turned every CMS base register's byte 0 into an address (I-234). With `VMAM31` kept by the three PSW gatekeepers and tested by GADR31/TRL31/DMKPTRAN, the G31 tape guest stores `AMODE 31` at 1FF0000 itself and takes an SVC with a 31-bit PSW. | **closed** 5 Oct 18:05 (i244, w114–w116). SNAP-I244. |
| 31 | **CP itself at AMODE 31 (I-224, M2 second step).** The LA-strip sweep (275 sites inventoried, 209 rewritten) and the PSW flip were the easy part; the walls were the idioms the sweep cannot see: a two-register `LA` sum at 16 MB in DMKFRE (I-225); a CCW word used as a base (I-226, I-232 — DMKDGD, DMKCCW, DMKDIB, DMKUNT, DMKTRK, DMKVCA); `BALR Rx,0` as a condition-code save (I-228, 16 sites → `IPM`), the trace subroutines reading the CC out of a `BAL` link register (I-229, 4 subroutines, and `N` after `SPM` was itself a bug); `doublewords || address` words handed to DMKFRET (I-230, stripped at the callee); and DMKVMI, CP code that executes **inside the guest** and must keep its 24-bit strips (I-231). Each was found by running, with pgmtrace, single breakpoints per run (Hercules 3 stops once), `ds` for the SCSW and the load map from the punched nucleus deck (I-227). | **closed** 5 Oct 13:22 (i241, w109–w111): LOGON with every LINK, AUTOLOG1's full init, `IPL 190` at 16M and `IPL CMS`, directory recompile, `DEF STOR 32M`, stores above 16 MB, IPL CMS at 32M, LOGOFF, SHUTDOWN, the GCCLIB regression — all clean. SNAP-I241 (clean restage, i242). |
| 33 | **The first paging workload (M5a: a 16 MB MAINT loading the CMS nucleus from the reader).** Nothing before it had made this CP page. Five defects in sequence, each hidden by the one before: `L Rx,CORSWPNT` carries CORFLAG in byte 0 (I-236, 13 sites); `LA R0,1(,R0)` is `LA R0,1`, so SYSTEM's resident-page count was 1 and the first steal of a CP page took it negative (I-237); DMKPAG's I/O-error flag rides in byte 0 of the CPEXBLOK exit address and DMKDSP branched through it (I-238); CE's VM50-4 is a preferred PAGE volume whose TEMP cylinders are 800-byte CMS format (I-239, pack patched); and a released PTE lost its invalid bit to a three-byte XC and mapped the guest's page to real frame 0, so the CMS loader wrote its PSWs into CP's PSA (I-240). | **closed** 5 Oct 23:37 (i245–i248, w160). SNAP-I248. |

| 34 | **EC-mode CMS (M5b).** XA0051DK converted 30 modules' PSW constants, decode sites and SSM masks, and the nucleus still ran in BC mode: DMSITS builds the startup PSW of every routine from scratch (`FF E0`). Then DIAG X'20' went to device 300 — in EC mode the IPL device address lives at X'BA', and CP's DMKVMI, which runs *inside the guest*, had been edited by I-47 to put it in `SYSIPLDV` (I-241); its wait PSW `CL4' INI'` was a specification exception, so the loop had no message. A reader IPL arrives in BC mode and DMSINI must switch itself. CP's EC reflection itself was right all along (`TRACE SVC`: `X'88' = 000200CA`). | **closed** 6 Oct 01:35 (i249, w169). SNAP-I249. |

**V0.1 saved** (tag `v0.1`, `32-V0.1.md`). Since then: `DEF STOR 32M` and
`64M` work — CP (`DMKDEH`) and `DIRECT` (`DMKDIR`) raised from 16 MB to 256 MB
(`I-203`), `USER MAINT CPCMS 16M 64M ABCDEFGH` compiled with `DIRECT USER
DIRECT A` → `EOJ DIRECTORY UPDATED AND ON LINE`; `q v stor` = `32768K`, CMS
IPLs and reaches `Ready;` in the 32M and 64M machine. CMS itself still says
`16384K` (CE's CMS is 24-bit), the CP console cannot `DISPLAY`/`STORE` above
16 MB (`I-207`), and a guest cannot run there until CP admits a 31-bit PSW
(docs/27, M-level). EXEC2 and REXX both work (wall 28 closed). Hercules 3.13 and 4.9.1
behave identically (`I-204`). `drive.py` runs a full dialogue in 15–25 s.

Side items opened: `I-201` DMKDMP cannot write its dump under ESA/390 (abend
registers come from Hercules until fixed); `I-197`/`I-198` build-tool gaps
found and closed on the way (stage every deck a module's AUXLCL names; derived
snapshots so a sliced build is restorable in minutes).

## Position on 1 October — the DAT conversion is written and verified (kept; superseded above)

**The segment- and page-table conversion is done and it assembles.** On
30 September CP reached `DMKDMP908I SYSTEM FAILURE; CODE PRG018` — a
translation-specification exception — because `CR1 = 05FFC840` pointed at a
segment table of System/370 STEs, `F00561D0 F00562A8 F0056380 …`, with `SEGPLEN`
in the high nibble where ESA/390 requires bit 0 to be zero. That is now
converted: roughly **700 cards across 23 modules in 53 update decks**, covering
the STE, the PTE, the segment-table designation in `VMSEG`, the table sizes, the
shifts, the masks and the alignment.

### What the verification build said

The first build of the whole conversion came back **180 of 192 modules clean**,
and the number that matters is from `tools/asmerr.py`:

    CONFIRMED    0  flagged and predicted
    MISSED       0  flagged but NOT predicted
    COLLIDED     0  a symbol this conversion introduced, already defined
    SILENT     176  predicted but NOT flagged -- no diagnostic exists

Every DAT field was renamed with **no alias** precisely so that an unconverted
site would fail with `IFO188 UNDEFINED SYMBOL` rather than quietly read the
wrong bytes. The previous build raised 176 such diagnostics. This one raises
none, in modules that did assemble — so every deck applied and every site was
converted.

The twelve diagnostics that remained had nothing to do with ESA/390. All four
causes are now asserted mechanically by `tools/replchk.py`, which reproduces all
twelve in under a second and which `mk()` refuses to build past:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| `SCOPE` | 7 | nine architecture constants put in `CORE COPY` (42 modules) instead of `EQU COPY` (179 of 192) |
| `LABEL-LOST` | 1 | a replacement dropped `PURCONT`, dangling three branches |
| `LABEL-DUP` | 1 | a deck emitted `CKSEG EQU *` that survives on an unreplaced record |
| `CONT-ORPHAN` | 1 | a replaced card carried an `X` in **column 72**; its continuation became a standalone statement |

The last is `R-04` from the other side — not a continuation marker written where
it should not be, but one *removed* where it was load-bearing. `mkdeck.card()`
asserts column 72 on cards it **writes**, which is why the failure had to arrive
through a record it does not write.

All four are fixed; the confirming build is running.

### Group 1 re-measured, and it is not ten sites

`IPL-WALLS.md` said group 1 had "10 cards left". `22-S370-ONLY.md`, in the same
directory, has held **200 nucleus sites across 28 modules** all along. Both were
written here and neither mentioned the other; the quoted figure had been the
wrong one for several sessions. `I-141`.

`tools/privchk.py` now reports the **remainder** where `s370only.py` reports the
total, and the two were reconciled before either was trusted: with the deck
subtraction disabled they agree **199 against 200**, the one difference being
`STIDC`, missing from `privchk`'s opcode list until the check found it.

**95 sites remain**, and the split matters more than the total:

- **62 storage-key sites** (`ISK`/`SSK`/`RRB`), `DMKPTR` holding 23.
- **33 synchronous channel sites** — `DMKLD00E` (19), `DMKVMI` (7), `DMKSAV` (5),
  `DMKCPI`, `DMKENT` — `SIO`/`TIO` polling loops in code that runs before there
  is an I/O supervisor to call. **`DMKLD00E` is the standalone loader that loads
  the nucleus**, so these cannot ride with the deferred multi-channel work: they
  are the IPL path.

### The storage-key family is cheaper than it looked, and provable first

CE sets `CPCREG0 DC X'81800CC0'` where base `PSA MACRO` has `X'80800CC0'`. The
added bit is `CR0_STORKEY_4K`, and Hercules tests it in exactly three places —
`insert_storage_key`, `reset_reference_bit`, `set_storage_key` — raising a
special-operation exception when it is **off**, which is the S/370 rule for
models with the 4 KB-key feature. **So CE already runs with 4 KB keys and both
halves of every paired operation already reach one key.**

That turns what looked like a design decision into an observation. Reading
replicates the one key into both halves and gives the *identical* register value
against CP's `X'0202'` mask; writing takes `SWPKEY1`, because the second `SSK`
already wins and already carries it. `SWPKEY1`/`SWPKEY2` stay independent guest
state either way, since `DMKPRV` answers a guest `ISK` from `SWPTABLE` and not
from hardware. No deviation to document — only register pressure per site.
And because `ISKE`/`SSKE`/`RRBE` are valid in S/370 too, all 67 sites can be
converted and **tested on CE as it runs today**, before anything else moves.
`23-STORAGE-KEYS.md` has it.

### The milestone plan has moved, in two places

`01-PROPOSAL.md` §6 carries M0–M5. Two corrections made on 30 September:

1. **M5 added** — real storage above 16 MB, the "C" axis of
   `WHAT-31BIT-NEEDS.md`. It had no milestone at all, so a deliberate deferral
   read as an oversight. Two of its 67 storage-key sites turned out to be on
   M1's critical path (`I-104`, `I-109`), which is the generalisable lesson:
   **ask which single site runs earliest, not how large the axis is.**
2. **M1 now requires part of B.** M1's premise "DAT off" is true and does not
   help: `LRA` translates **explicitly**, whatever the PSW says, so CP's 174
   `TRANS` sites consult the tables during initialisation. M1 therefore needs a
   valid ESA/390 segment-table designation and STE format for the tables CP
   builds for itself. `06-LEDGER.md`'s test 8 predicted this from the other
   direction. **No site count changes — only the sequencing.**

Also recorded: **we are running strategy A** (IPL from DASD: 12 modules, 82 DAT
references), not the strategy B the worklist chose (`loadcore`: 9 modules, 12).
Nobody wrote that down, and the worklist's estimate has been quoted since as
though B were still in force.

### The build, and why it is circular

`claude/BUILD-CYCLE.md` is the operational document: **a successful build
replaces the CP that performed it with one that cannot perform the next one.**
Four phases, snapshot before the nucleus write, snapshot with Hercules down.
Restoring a snapshot rewinds every deck that postdates it — `I-111`.

Every test runs on **both Hercules 3.13 and 4.9.1** (`build.sh dual`).

### The instruments, which are now the valuable part

Deck generation and running:

- `tools/mkdeck.py` — UPDATE decks with enforced column discipline, ordering and
  8-digit sequence numbers. It refuses bad cards rather than truncating, and its
  `aux()` **merges** an AUXLCL rather than replacing it (`I-138`).
- `tools/mkrun.py` — generates a whole verification run from specs, plus
  `boot_failed()` and `wrong_arch()`, which read the boot and the architecture
  back **out of the run's own log**.
- `tools/build.sh` — the driver. Archives each log before overwriting it
  (`I-131`), tests diagnostic **severity** rather than whether output exists
  (`I-137`), and refuses to start on stale staged cards or a broken deck
  invariant.

Checks that gate a build:

- `tools/replchk.py` — the four `./ R` invariants above.
- `tools/iochk.py` — every staged card-reader file still matches its deck.
  `mk` snapshots the decks before Hercules starts, so a deck edited mid-build is
  silently absent from it (`I-140`).
- `tools/symchk.py` — scope-aware symbol collisions: a deck on a module reaches
  that module, a deck on a member reaches every module that copies it.
- `mkdeck.auxcheck()` — every generated deck is listed in its member's AUXLCL.

Measurement:

- `tools/asmerr.py` — reconciles the assembler's diagnostics against the
  predicted sweep. CONFIRMED / MISSED / COLLIDED / SILENT, with a hard
  cross-check against the count the log states about itself.
- `tools/deckchk.py` — every flagged site is covered by a deck anchor.
- `tools/block.py` — prints the basic block around each flagged site with its
  silent neighbours marked, because a converted field's *neighbours* have no
  diagnostic.
- `tools/idiom.py` — fourteen idiom classes with per-class scope tests.
- `tools/privchk.py` — the S/370-only remainder, reconciled against
  `s370only.py`.
- `tools/dumpscan.py` — reads a printed CP dump back into a byte image and
  measures it. This is what proved `I-116`.
- `tools/s370only.py`, `selfrel.py`, `shifts.py`, `dattab.py` — the sweeps.
- `tools/tally.py` — regenerates `13-ISSUES.md`'s status counts from the table.
- `herc:pgmtrace +1` — Hercules traces program interrupts and **disassembles and
  names** them, including the ECPS:VM assists.

### The one lesson worth carrying, stated plainly

On 30 September, five separate times, work was based on **a check that could not
fail**. On 1 October the shape changed: five times, work was based on **an
artefact that read as current and was not.**

A build log overwritten by the build that depended on it (`I-131`). An AUXLCL
entry overwritten by a later generator, so a verified deck would never have been
applied (`I-138`). A card-reader file snapshotted before a deck was corrected
(`I-140`). A site count written down from three modules and quoted as a total for
several sessions (`I-141`). A status tally that had drifted from its own table by
24 entries. Four of the five were my own record of a measurement rather than the
measurement.

The fix was the same every time: **stop storing the answer, store the thing that
derives it.** `iochk` derives the card file from the deck. `privchk` derives the
count from the source. `tally` derives the summary from the table. None of them
can go stale, because none of them remember anything.

Two further habits earned their place the same day. A tool's green light means
only what it claims — `deckchk` reported zero uncovered for `DMKVMA` while two
sites were unconverted, because it checks anchors and not semantics. And **a
check whose output is mostly noise is not a check**: `replchk` first reported 411
candidates, the three real failures invisible among them.

### Issue register

`13-ISSUES.md`: **139 entries, 79 fixed, 13 open.** Closed entries are kept
deliberately, including the retracted claims — six of the twenty-three, and
three more added on 1 October. The counts are generated by `tools/tally.py`
rather than maintained, after the hand-written ones drifted by 24 entries.

That retraction count is the number to watch. A review that only ever finds good
news is not reviewing.

## The documents, and the order to read them

| Doc | What it is |
|---|---|
| **STATE.md** | this file — current position, what is on which machine |
| **BUILD-CYCLE.md** | why each build destroys the machine that performs it. Read before building |
| **WHAT-31BIT-NEEDS.md** | the A/B/C distinction, populations, the four undesigned items |
| **GOTCHAS.md** | the expensive knowledge. Read before touching anything |
| **STE-DESIGN.md** | the ESA/390 table formats, the alignment decision, the order of work |
| **DAT-CONVERSION.md** | how the conversion was made and measured: four instruments, fourteen idiom classes, seven checks |
| **IPL-WALLS.md** | what stands between the current state and an IPL without errors |
| **VM370CE31-PROPOSAL.md** | the 31-bit plan, written for Adrian |
| **CP-VERIFIED.md** | two design hypotheses checked against CP source |
| **CP-INVENTORY.md** | the architecture-dependency counts |
| **IO-ROUTE.md** | channel subsystem: traps, references, revised estimate |
| **FINDINGS.md** | the measurement record, including retractions |
| **ROUTES.md** | the three routes sized against each other |
| **RECONSTRUCT.md** | how to rebuild the cc370 toolchain |
| **REPO-PLAN.md** | repository layout, not yet acted on |

In the repository, `docs/01-PROPOSAL.md` §6 holds the live M0–M5 plan,
`docs/13-ISSUES.md` the issue register, and `docs/22-S370-ONLY.md`,
`23-STORAGE-KEYS.md` and `25-BOOTSTRAP-IO.md` the group-1 inventory — read those
three before planning any S/370-only work, because they already hold the
measurement.

## Two projects now, and they are separate

**1. cREXX on VM/370 CE** — build 92 ships and runs. This was the original
work and it is paused rather than finished.

**2. A 31-bit VM/370 CE** — Mike's stated priority as of 26 September:
"a compatible VM/370 CE first on 31 bit, and ideally later 64". cREXX is
explicitly set aside for this. Mike confirmed on 30 September that **virtual
31-bit addressing is mandatory, not optional** — "otherwise the whole migration
does not make much sense".

The connection: cREXX's compiler needs about 18 MB and CMS gives it 16.
But note that **31-bit CP alone does not fix that** — see the proposal §5.

---

## Project 2: the 31-bit conversion — the 26 September picture

Everything in this section predates any change to CP. It is kept because the
measurements are still good; where it disagrees with **Current position** above,
the later text wins.

### Hardware question: ANSWERED

Eight standalone tests passed on **stock, unpatched Hercules**, ARCHMODE
ESA/390, no operating system:

| Test | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | hand-built DAT tables accepted, DAT runs | yes |
| 2 | the page table is actually walked | walked |
| 3 | AMODE 31 switch works, DAT survives it | yes |
| 4a | above-the-line **virtual** address translates | yes |
| 4b | …to an above-the-line **real** frame | yes |
| 5 | MSCH/SSCH/TSCH drives a real device | yes |
| 6 | `ORB5_I` gives `SCSW1_Z` and deferred cc 0 | yes |
| 7 | an I/O **interruption** arrives and identifies its subchannel | yes |
| 8 | `LRA` behaves as `TRANS` assumes, in both modes | **no, in 24-bit** |

Test 4b is load-bearing: a store at virtual `X'01005000'` in 31-bit mode with
DAT on lands at real `X'01100000'`, and real `X'5000'` stays zero.

**Test 8 is the one that keeps mattering.** In 24-bit mode `LRA`'s *operand*
address is masked before translation, so it answers correctly about the wrong
page — cc=0 and a plausible real address. Its result is not truncated; its
question is. That moved AMODE 31 into M2, and on 30 September the same property
pulled the segment-table format into M1.

### Milestone 0: closed, and used in anger

`XAOPS.MACRO` — the ESA/390 instructions as macros for CE's 1970s assembler —
was read onto MAINT's A-disk, built with `MACLIB GEN XALIB XAOPS`, and all
twelve members assembled by CE's own Assembler XF. `R-17` closed. Since then
the macro set has grown to include `ISKE`, `SSKE`, `RRBE`, `IVSK`, `IPTE` and
`TPROT`, each noted as proven by execution in its own test script.

**This is CP's own idiom** — 21 sites already use `DC X'E6nn',S(...)` for
the ECPS:VM assists. Those 21 sites became `I-114`: they are S/370-only, CP
executes one *before* it probes for them, and all 21 are now no-opped at
assembly time with the same six bytes CP's own recovery writes at run time.

### The source

Adrian's maintained tree is at `/home/claude/vmce` — 201 CP `.ASSEMBLE`,
59 `.MACRO`, 56 `.COPY`, 314 CMS members, plus `kernel-c/`, `network/`,
`wide/`, `changes/`, `maintenance/`. It survives container reclaims because it
sits outside `scratchpad/`; the CE extraction and every built nucleus do not.

`maintenance/files/194/CPLOAD.EXEC` is CP's own nucleus load list — 174 modules.
It is the authority on whether a module is in the nucleus, and therefore on
whether a site is on the IPL path at all. `DMKFMT`, `DMKDDR`, `DMKDIR` and
`DMKSSP` are standalone utilities outside it.

### What the source showed

Detail in CP-VERIFIED.md and CP-INVENTORY.md. The headlines:

**The biggest item is a compatibility decision.** Segment size goes from
64 KB to 1 MB — ESA/390 has no 64 KB option. The consequence is shared
segments: `DMKATS` and named saved systems are built on 64 KB granularity,
and the minimum shareable unit becomes 1 MB. No parameter solves that.
**Running CE settled it**: `USER DIRECT` puts eight machines at 15 MB and
CMS's shared segments at 15.0–15.7 MB, so a 1 MB common segment 15 would
expose private storage. Frame-level sharing never marks a segment common, so
it is now the only viable route rather than a preference.

**`DMKVAT` is probably the least of the DAT work, not the most.** It is
already parameterised by architecture — `GPR 9 = ARCHITECTURE CONTROL
INDEX` indexes `ARCHTECT`, which has `PTEINCR`, `PINVBIT` and `ZEROBIT` as
table entries, and **four of its eight variants already use fullword page
table entries**. `CODE70` has `SEGMASK X'7FF00000'` — 2,048 one-megabyte
segments, a 31-bit address space. `PINVBIT DC X'04'` and `LOADPTE`'s `LH`/`L`
pair are a third independent witness for the ESA/390 PTE layout, arrived at
from CP's own source rather than from the architecture manual.

**I/O is ten instruction sites, not 1,493 references.** Every S/370 I/O
instruction in `DMKIOS` is a single instruction with the same `0(R1)`
operand; the CAW is built in two places. A shim that synthesises a CSW at
`X'40'` after each `TSCH` leaves all 1,917 CAW/CSW references working.

**`TRANS`, invoked 174 times, concentrates the translation interface.**
Converting one macro covers 174 sites.

**Two retractions of my own claims**: `BAL`/`BALR` self-correct in 31-bit
mode, so only mode boundaries matter; and the DAT table work is owned by
`DMKPGS` (96), `DMKATS` (73) and `DMKBLD` (63) more than by `DMKVAT` (55).

### Setup

**CE's own config must be `ARCHMODE S/370` to build** and `ESA/390` to test.
`mkrun.archmode()` flips ARCHMODE, CPUMODEL, ECPSVM and MAINSIZE together,
because `CPUMODEL 4381` is a machine that does not exist in ESA/390 and
`ECPSVM YES` declares assists whose opcodes are S/370-only. A build driver
must reset S/370 on exit, and a diagnostic afterwards must set ESA/390 and
**verify it from the log** — `I-115`.

---

## The /380 route: three measurements outstanding

Closed on 25 September on evidence that turned out invalid — the CR13
reading was of the *virtual* register, and real CR13 measures zero with CP
up. The conclusion may still be right; it is untested. On Mike's machines,
needing nobody else:

1. **Real CR13 with a guest genuinely executing** — `stop` mid-compile on
   the build-92 machine, then `cr`.
2. **The `ECMODE` flag** on that userid's `USER DIRECT` entry. If absent,
   `DMKDSP` never reloads CR4–13 and (1) is a formality.
3. **`MEMTEST` on the VM/380 machine**, capturing `r 8E.2`, the PSW and the
   faulting address rather than inferring the failure.

Why it still matters: S/380 needs neither a DAT nor an I/O rewrite, so it is
far cheaper *if* CR13 cooperates — against which it needs a patched

## Project 1: cREXX on VM/370 CE — paused

### What works

**Build 92 ships and runs.** Compiler, assembler, linker and virtual
machine built on the mainframe, installing from five card decks. Verified
end to end 25 Sept:

    RXCOK -o T T.rexx     compile
    RXASOK T              assemble
    RXVM T                run

    073/MV no XXERc
    3 25 Sep 2026 16:49:54
    255 FF NUM
    padded|

That exercises reverse, words, date, time, x2d, d2x, datatype and strip —
the EBCDIC fixes, the library link, the compiler finding the library
through CMS enumeration, and the VM reading the module.

**Library:** 61 of 146 members, PC-built, linked by MKLIB. 49 were compiled
natively on 24 Sept but that copy went with a temporary disk.

### What is on which machine

Three distinct Hercules installations, easily confused:

  - **build-92 machine** — VM/370 CE, stock Hercules 3.07, `ARCHMODE
    S/370`. 191 disk: PDPCLIB TXTLIB (2011 build), RXVM MODULE, T REXX.
    250 disk (317 MB pack, the A disk): RXCOK / RXASOK / RXLNKOK MODULEs,
    TA01-TA42 TEXT, P1 REXX, T REXX.
  - **VM/380 machine** — the patched Hercules 3.07:380-5.0, `Modes: S/370
    S/380 ESA/390 z/Arch`. For `MEMTEST` only.
  - **the ESA/390 lab** — `herc.conf`, no DASD. For the standalone tests.

Check the Hercules banner every time. Two of the three are version 3.07 and
both offer ESA/390.

### What is not finished

**85 missing library members.** Importing more than about 60 exhausts the
compiler — one parse context per exposed procedure, 554 for the full
library. Reported to Adrian; the fix is lazy parsing on import, upstream.

**Four members blocked on a decision**: datatype, fsayfmt, trace, rxjson
test whether a character is a letter by range. EBCDIC letters come in three
blocks with gaps. Needs a VM instruction or an agreed library helper — with
Adrian.

**format and qscan** exceed PDPCLIB's fixed 256 KB stack in RXAS's flow
analysis.

**_typedformat** wants about 18 MB to assemble. Compiled for the first time
on 26 Sept; never assembled.

### Upstream, reported but unfixed

  - Import memory: one parse context per exposed procedure
  - Storage leak: ~400 KB per RXC or RXAS run, unrecovered until IPL
  - Inline payloads emitted as single .meta records of 36+ KB, which RXAS
    cannot read back

### Patches written, not submitted

  - 18 against mvslovers/cc370 at ba58285
  - 8 against cREXX
  - 2 in GCCLIB (the `&&`-for-`&` stack rounding, and fopen's file id)

Packaged as `cc370-cms-toolchain.zip` with README and PATCHES.md.

## Owed to the team

Not sent, and they belong in one note:

  - **The above-the-line retraction.** Three published measurements were
    24-bit truncation artifacts. FINDINGS.md has the detail.
  - **VMARC does not fail on large archives.** Fifteen decks exceeded the
    CMS 65,535-record limit — DEVDK at 122,651. Ross found it and has had
    the correction; the wider team has not.
  - **The 31-bit result.** This is now much more than a hardware claim: a
    converted CP initialises and dumps itself under ESA/390, and the DAT
    table conversion assembles clean across 23 modules. Worth framing
    carefully, with the IPL stated plainly as not yet achieved.

## What Adrian already has, which changes the plan

From three documents supplied 26 September:

  - **CP and CMS build from Git and boot** — 183 CP and 89 CMS TEXT
    members, two clean builds, all 266 decks binary-identical between runs.
    This closes the gate this project would otherwise have listed first.
  - **C is already in the CMS nucleus** — `DMSFRE STAT`'s chain
    calculation, built with the maintained GCC port, qualified with
    differential tests, reboot, reversal and exact restoration.
  - **Networking exists** — CP C switch plus CMS lwIP, whole-frame DIAG
    transfers, a third service VM, external HTTP passing.
  - **`wide/` is z/Architecture**, not 31-bit — freestanding, GCC s390x
    LP64, `z900`, ELF64 via `loadcore`, DAT fixtures in W-02/03. Explicitly
    not an OS or a CMS boot image, so it reads as a 64-bit *application*
    environment. Same method as our eight tests.
  - **Neither kernel is 31-bit yet**, stated explicitly.
  - He is on **Hercules 4.9.1**, so `FEATURE_370_EXTENSION` is available to
    him — useless for addressing but it backports relative branches,
    immediates, MVCLE and CMPSC into S/370 mode.

## Kit b16 (14 October 2026, afternoon)

Java and NetRexx on both sides (9.34, 9.35) and the I-290 CP fix. Built
from the dev pack after LANGGEN (lg16) and the directory change (MAINT
16M 256M, DIRUP EXEC). 18 parts: 1-5 as before, Debian 6-15 (255 MB),
LANG 16-18 (60 MB). Verified on a fresh CE + all parts (kt30): CMSUSER
JAVA HELLO 3.3 s, JAVAC HELLO 24 s, NETREXX HELLO 24 s, NETREXX HELLO
COMPILE 45 s, JAVA HELLO (NetRexx class) 3.6 s, LOGOFF clean; MAINT
Debian at 192 MB: java -version, javac Hello.java && java Hello 294 s;
poweroff, SHUTDOWN clean.

JamVM on CMS: arch/31bit/java/cms (green threads, generated JNI stubs,
Classpath natives, dlsym table, cmsrt additions). ecj 3.5.2 built from
eclipse-jdt tag R3_5_2 (compiler, batch, compiler.tool) against glibj.

## Kit b17 (15 October 2026, 00:05)

The CP guest LAN (9.12b): `CP DEFINE LCS vaddr` gives an ESA/390 user a
CP-simulated 3088-60 LCS (module DMKVLN in DMKVSI, `updates/vlncode.py`);
Linux's lcs driver makes the pair eth0, all adapters are on one segment
10.3.0.0/24. Steps A-D tested on the dev pack (lb3-lb11): two Linux guests
ping each other, 1400-byte frames, logoff/re-logon/offline-online/DETACH
under traffic; Debian with `vm370plus-lan` (rc.local; address from
`/etc/vm370plus-lan.conf` by `vmcp q userid`); TCP 200 KB intact at about
37 KB/s. I-292 (FRE013 from a cross-user CPEXBLOK pump) fixed with a PCI
kick; I-293 (Debian `halt -i` hangs with eth0 up) worked around with
NETDOWN=no. The Debian disk has kernel #11 (LCS) and the bookie fixes;
`vm370plus/linux/linux11.rdr` is kernel #11 as a reader deck. 18 parts.
Verified on a fresh CE + all parts (kt31): MAINT Debian comes up with eth0
10.3.0.2 by itself, CMSUSER's in-storage Linux joins as 10.3.0.3, ping both
ways, poweroff ends in the disabled wait, SHUTDOWN clean. (The test adds a
001F 3215 line to the conf for the second terminal; enabling 00A for it
needs VARY ONLINE after the client connects.)

Also on 14/15 Oct: BookMaster manuals VMP-0003 (Status) and VMP-0004
(BOOKIE) in `manual/bookmaster`, and three vmplus.tmac/bookie fixes.

## Kit b18 (15 October 2026, 04:15)

BORDER (9.12c): the guest LAN's way out. Service machine BORDER (IPL CMS,
64M, 191 on VM50U1 71-90 with LINUX12 KERNEL1/2, BORDER EXEC, PROFILE EXEC;
CTC pair 0606/0607 DEDICATEd as 626/636) runs kernel #12's in-storage Linux
(netfilter + Debian's iptables 1.4.14 in the initramfs): eth0 10.3.0.1,
ctc0 10.1.4.2; NAT out, FORWARD/INPUT firewall, port forwards from BORDER
CONFIG on MAINT 19E (mode 2). Start: AUTOLOG BORDER BORDER. LAN guests
without a CTC route via 10.3.0.1 (initramfs and vm370plus-lan). Parts: the
VM50U1 shadow moved to part 4 (part 1 stays under 30 MB). Verified on a
fresh CE + all parts with the 0606 line enabled (kt32): BORDER comes up by
AUTOLOG with both forwards, CMSUSER's in-storage Linux (10.3.0.3) pings the
PC through the NAT, `ssh -p 2223` to 10.1.4.2 reaches it, SHUTDOWN clean.
I-294 (READCARD under IPL 290) and I-295 (AUTOLOG first command under IPL
290 goes to CP) found and open.

## Kit b19 (15 October 2026, 05:30)

9.12d: BORDER also runs busybox udhcpd on the LAN (10.3.0.100-199, router
and DNS 10.3.0.1) and passes 10.3.0.1:53 on to `DNS a.b.c.d` from BORDER
CONFIG (default the PC, 10.1.4.1). The in-storage Linux asks by udhcpc when
it has no `vmlan=` and no CTC; Debian's vm370plus-lan uses dhclient when its
user has no address in /etc/vm370plus-lan.conf and no CTC. Verified on a
fresh CE + all parts (kt33): BORDER by AUTOLOG, CMSUSER's in-storage Linux
got 10.3.0.100 by DHCP, `nslookup test.example` answered through BORDER by a
test resolver on the PC, ping to the PC through the NAT, SHUTDOWN clean.
9.12a-d (the network pack) are done.

## Kit b20 (15 October 2026, 17:10)

M8.2 (the current cREXX built natively on CMS: RXC82, RXAS82, RXBVM82 and
CRX82 EXEC / CRXROOT TAR to rebuild them), Regina 3.9.5 on CMS (REGINA
MODULE on the language disk, 9.37), ooRexx 5.3 in the Debian guest (9.9),
the cmsrt/XL/cc1 storage fixes, I-297 (DMSEFS FORMAT freed another EDF
disk's FST hyperblock) and I-298 (CP DUMP). 19 parts: VM50U1's shadow moved
to its own part 6 (part 4 had reached 33 MB), Debian 7-16, LANG 17-19.
Verified on a fresh CE + all parts (kt34): CMSUSER LANG, REGINA RT.REX,
RXC82/RXAS82/RXBVM82 on C82HELLO ("Hello from natively built cREXX on
VM/370plus"), FORMAT of a T3350 as EDF then COPYFILE to it and STATE on L
(rc 0), CP DUMP 0-FFFF and 1000000-100FFFF, SHUTDOWN clean. The Debian disk
is the dev disk on which ooRexx was installed and tested (rx1).

## Kit b21 (15 October 2026, 22:50)

9.39, REXX dispatch and Regina as a CMS REXX: an EXEC's first line
`/*!name` runs it by the command `name` (DMSEXC XA0057DK); `SETREXX
name|BREXX` sets the interpreter for plain `/*` EXECs (NUCON word);
XLRES (nucleus extension, loaded by SYSPROFX under IPL 290) keeps
XIMAGEs resident above 16 MB with a fresh copy per call, and LANG loads
Regina into it, so Regina EXECs nest; Regina uses the CMS console stack
(PUSH/QUEUE/QUEUED), serves EXECCOMM (EXECIO STEM/VAR, GLOBALV GET/PUT)
and gives PARSE SOURCE in CMS form. cmsrt: cms_subcom, the extended
plist on CMS commands, cms_program_init; XL rebuilt. 19 parts as b20.
Verified on a fresh CE + all parts (kt35): CMSUSER (64M, IPL 290) LANG,
XLRES lists REGINA, BANG (/*!REGINA) rc 7, NEST -> BANG rc 7 back, rc 5,
STK/SHOWQ lines both ways between Regina and BREXX, EIO (EXECIO STEM
LN.0=4, VAR, GLOBALV GET/PUT/STACK), SETREXX REGINA/BREXX switching
PLAIN between the two, REGINA RT.REX, SHUTDOWN clean.

## Kit b22 (16 October 2026, 07:45)

9.41 and 9.42. vmspool.py sends files from the PC into a user's reader
through two socket card readers (010C text, 020C binary/stream), which
AUTOLOG1 starts; a file with lines over 80 goes as a stream and UNSTREAM
EXEC rebuilds it. MDPRINT EXEC (19E) prints Markdown on CMS (TYPE, DISK,
PRINT: headings, nested lists, code, quotes, tables); `(PS` goes to the
Debian `markdown` vmspool handler (md2ms, which carries the ms subset it
needs since groff-base has no ms, and groff -t). Debian also has md2ms and
mdprint. Fixed on the way: MDPRINT helper routines clobbered LIST's
variables (now PROCEDUREs); Python 3.2's re rejects `(\s*\1){2,}`. The
Debian disk is lnx190 (GOTCHAS). 19 parts. New: kit/kittest.sh (fresh CE,
all parts, dev parked and restored). Verified (kt36): PCHELLO EXEC and
SAMPLE MD sent from the PC by vmspool.py arrived in CMSUSER's reader with
no operator action, UNSTREAM 37 lines, MDPRINT TYPE and DISK correct,
SHUTDOWN clean. The Debian handler was verified on the dev disk (mdd4).

## Kit b23 (16 October 2026, 09:45)

9.40 and 9.18. BORDER runs vmdns (kernel #13, LINUX13 KERNEL1/2 on its 191):
the local zone vm370plus.lan from BORDER CONFIG (DOMAIN, HOST, MX), other
names relayed to the PC; DHCP hands out the search domain; Debian's
vm370plus-lan writes the LAN names into /etc/hosts. Mail: the Debian guest
(MAINT) is the mail host -- vmmaild (SMTP, port 25) delivers
userid@vm370plus.lan to the user's reader as `sender MAIL` through
vmspoold's new outbox; SENDMAIL EXEC (19E) sends a note over the `mail`
service (CMS users at once, others by SMARTHOST or MX); GETMAIL EXEC (19E)
reads MAIL files into MAILnnnn MAIL A; LXCALL (19D) orders its answer to
the front of the reader. Verified (dns2, mail1 on dev; kt37 on a fresh CE +
b23): LINUX13 and the zone in BORDER CONFIG shipped; Debian booted with
vmmaild; CMSUSER SENDMAIL to cmsuser and maint ("in the reader of CMSUSER",
"kept in /var/spool/vmspool/mail/maint"), GETMAIL "MAIL0148 MAIL A
cmsuser@vm370plus.lan kit b23 mail test"; SHUTDOWN clean. 19 parts.
Note: MAINT 19D is 99% full.

## Kit b24 (16 October 2026, 11:30)

9.10, 9.44, 9.17. ASK EXEC (19E) and the Debian service `ask` (the AI
gateway: OpenAI-protocol servers such as llama.cpp's llama-server or Ollama
on the PC, or Anthropic's API, per /etc/vmspool.d/ask.conf; per-user
history). A socket printer 010E (class P, started by AUTOLOG1) with
tools/vmprint.py on the PC and PCPRINT EXEC on CMS. llama2.c for big-endian
31-bit: LLAMA EXEC + LLAMA2C MODULE + LLAMATOK BIN on the language disk,
llama/llama2c in Debian; bit-exact with the PC. I-294 closed (I-297).
Verified on a fresh CE + b24 (kt38): AUTOLOG1 started 10E CLASS P NOSEP and
vmprint connected; CMSUSER (IPL 290, LANG) ran LLAMA on a random-weight
model with the PC's 24 tokens; PCPRINT of a listing arrived on the PC as a
.txt; ASK present. The ask service and vmmaild are on the shipped Debian
disk (installed in dev, mdd5/ask1). 19 parts.

## Kit b25 (16 October 2026, 17:15)

9.43, 9.17 finished. EXEC 2: EXEC2 EXEC (19E) and the DMSEXC change in
the 290 nucleus (first line &TRACE -> EXEC2). MAINT's PROFILE EXEC
(ACCESS 5E5 B/B) restored. The llama model is downloaded, not shipped:
Debian `llama --get` (URL and MD5 in /etc/llama.conf, vm370plus.com);
CMS `LLAMA GET fm` (service llamaget; vmspoold's outbox FILE option punches
the file binary, 16 words per header now); the language disk carries no
model. Guide refreshed. Verified on a fresh CE + b25 (kt39): MAINT logs on
with B = 5E5 and PROFILE EXEC A; CMSUSER under IPL 290 ran the EXEC 2
test t1 by dispatch and by EXEC2, EXEC 1 and REXX still run as before;
LLAMA EXEC/LLAMA2C MODULE/LLAMATOK BIN on L, no STORIES BIN, LLAMA says
the model is not found. LLAMA GET end to end on dev (llg2, small model).
19 parts.
