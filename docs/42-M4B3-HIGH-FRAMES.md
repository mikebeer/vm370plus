# M4b.3 — guest pages in real frames above 16 MB (started 11 October 2026)

M4b.2/M4b.4 use real storage above 16 MB as a paging store (MVCL slots, doc 38).
CP still has only the 16 MB of frames below the line, and that is what makes two
Debians at once unusable (I-254): their working sets do not fit, and the
scheduler keeps one of them in the eligible list. M4b.3 lets **guest pages**
live in frames above 16 MB, as VM/SP HPO did. CP's own storage, locked and V=R
pages, SYSTEM-space pages (spool buffers) and shared-segment pages stay below.

## Inventory (11 October, read from all 201 modules with our decks applied)

The merged sources the survey read are produced by `tools/applied.py
assembled()`. About 85 sites in 25 modules; the classes:

| Class | Where | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| CP drops to AMODE 24 after an inline TRANS / DMKPTRAN's LRA | TRANS macro (34 sites), DMKPTR PTRLRA | **done** (step 1): CP stays in AMODE 31 |
| Channel programs with a guest frame in a 24-bit CCW address | DMKCCW CCWNXT9 (one-page area), DMKDGD NOTCHG1, DMKPAG SETRWCCW (paging), HDKD7C | a high frame always goes through an IDAL (IDAWs are 31-bit); the IDA paths for page-crossing areas exist in DMKCCW and DMKDGD |
| IDAW consumers that assume 24 bits | DMKUNT IDASET, DMKVCA (`CLI 0(R4),X'00'`, `TM 0(R1),X'FF'`), DMKDIB (`N =X'00FFFFF0'`), DMKISM, HDKD7C (`X2048BND`) | 31-bit masks on IDAW values |
| `XPAGNUM` (X'00FFF000') / `X2048BND` (X'00FFF800') on real frame addresses | DMKPTR (LRA result, PTRUL, PTRLK), DMKPSA key checks, DMKCCW, DMKUNT, DMKDGD, DMKCDS, DMKATS, DMKVMA, HDKD7C/8C | per site: 31-bit where the value is a frame address (an IDAW or an LRA result); unchanged where it is a 24-bit CCW word (a non-IDA CCW only ever points to a low frame) |
| Range checks against `DMKSYSRM` (16 MB since M4b.4) | DMKPTRUL (abend 2 above it), DMKUNT, DMKVCA, DMKDIB | check against the top of frames |
| Allocator | DMKPTR PAGFREE/GETFREE, DMKPTRFT/CHAINPAG, FREEQ hand-off, DMKPTRFR/FE, SELECT's scan blocks; DMKCPI CORLOOP | a second free list for high frames, taken only by a guest page-in (SETWAIT1) for a non-SYSTEM, non-V=R, non-shared page; CORTABLE entries for the high frames |

Uncertain and to be read when the work gets there: DMKTRK's set-file-mask
argument, DMKMNI's page, an IOBLOK copied for paging error recovery (DMKPAG
WTPGERR, DMKIOS) keeping its IDAL.

## Plan

| Step | Content | Observable |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | AMODE 31 after TRANS and DMKPTRAN's LRA | **done** f6f85d6: gcclib-15m, m5g-native, IPL LINUX to the login prompt |
| 2 | IDAW consumers and real-address masks 31-bit clean (no high frame in use yet) | the regression unchanged |
| 3 | DMKPAG: paging I/O through a two-IDAW list when the frame is high | the regression unchanged |
| 4 | DMKCCW / DMKDGD: a one-page data area in a high frame through an IDAL | the regression unchanged |
| 5 | CORTABLE for frames up to a frames top; the second free list; a switch | **done** 11 Oct: on (160 MB); m5g-native at 256 MB, IPL LINUX to the login prompt |
| 6 | Two Debians at once (I-254) | both reach the login prompt and answer over the network |

## Step 5 status (11 October, morning)

**Works.** `CPIBFT` in the DMKCPI deck (XA0053DK) is the frames top:
`X'0A000000'`, so at MAINSIZE 256 the frames from 16 MB to 160 MB are on
DMKPTR's high list (`DMKPTRH1`, count `DMKPTRHN`, top `DMKPTRHT`) and the
M4b.2 paging store begins above them. DMKPTR PAGHIGH gives one to any guest
page-in that is not SYSTEM space and not a named-system page; a frame comes back
to the high list, never to a FREEQ waiter, is never stolen and never flushed.
`X'01000000'` turns it all off (no high frames, the old table size).

Measured: m5g-native at 256 MB as at 16 MB (the two known timeouts, `Ready(00003)`,
`0.1`); IPL LINUX in a 64 MB machine to `vm370plus login:` with RES 5950 pages
(23 MB, more than the 14 MB of low frames there are).

What it took besides the allocator -- each found with high frames switched on,
and each invisible below 16 MB:

| | Defect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| I-259 | SVC 12 returned in AMODE 24 after every CALL made in AMODE 31: SAVEPROC is byte 0 of SAVERETN, and the affinity path's strip took the mode bit | SVCRETAF keeps bit 0 |
| I-260 | Ten command processors bump SAVERETN with LA, which clears bit 0 | STCM of the low three bytes |
| I-261 | DMKCFG's named-system loop counted 64 KB segments, overrunning the segment table | SRL 8 |
| I-262 | DMKDGD (step 4): IDAW 2 could name the next frame, which DGUNLOK then unlocked (PTR003) | IDAW 2 stays in the frame |
| -- | DMKCPI runs AMODE 24 and keeps 24-bit BAL links across CALLs | its last GOTO goes through DMKCPIGO (DMKCPIB), which switches to AMODE 31 for the dispatcher and sets TRL31ON in DMKPSA |

The tools that found them: a Hercules instruction break on the ABEND's SVC 0
(`b 40e80` before `/cold`, then `gpr`), and an instruction trace (`t+` ... `t-`)
around the failing command, read for the PSW's AMODE bit at each SVC.

How the storage above 16 MB is shared between frames and the M4b.2 paging store
is decided at step 5 (simplest: frames up to a configured top, the store above it).

## Way back

If a nucleus does not IPL, `tools/nucpatch.py` and a standalone load of the
punched deck under `ARCHMODE S/370` restore a working CP without a pack
restore (doc 37, 11 October).
