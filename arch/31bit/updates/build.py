"""Build the AUXLCL update decks for the 31-bit conversion.

The conversion is delivered as CE's own local update level rather than as edits
to base source: `594/DMKLCL.CNTRL` stacks `LCL AUXLCL` over `HRC AUXHRC` over
`TEXT AUXR60`, and the LCL level is empty and reserved for exactly this. See
../../../docs/15-UPDATE-LEVELS.md.

    python3 build.py            # writes the decks next to this file, verified

    CPACC
    VMFMAC DMKLCL DMKLCL        rebuild the local MACLIB with the updated PSA

`DMKLCL MACLIB` is first in the `MACS` record, and `VMFASM` does
`GLOBAL MACLIB &1 &2 ...` in that order, so a `PSA` member there overrides the
one in `DMKMAC` without touching `DMKMAC` at all.

    4: the four TIO sites, two HDV sites and two TCH sites are a second deck,
    because each needs its condition-code flow re-derived rather than
    substituted, and those instructions still assemble as S/370 meanwhile.

    Every access uses a base CP already holds -- R10 for the IOBLOK, R8 for
    the RDEVBLOK, R0 for the PSA -- so no register is borrowed anywhere and
    no USING is added.  That was worth the redesign: at the SSCH site the

    # 1b. I-174, wall 16.  The ORB's interruption parameter is the ONLY way an
    #     ESA/390 I/O interrupt can carry anything of CP's choosing, and the
    #     template left it zero -- so the hardware handed back zero and
    #     `DMKIOT`'s `CLC IOINTPRM+2(2),IOBRADD` could never match ANY device.
    #     Every asynchronous completion was therefore unroutable and dropped.
    #
    #     DASD hid it completely: its status is normally already pending at
    #     `SSCH`, so cc=1 takes the synchronous `IOSXCC1`/`TSCH` path and never
    #     needs an interrupt at all.  1,474 channel programs of nucleus load
    #     and directory read all went that way.  The console write completes
    #     asynchronously, and it was the first thing in five days that actually
    #     depended on the interrupt path.
    #
    #     Measured: `IOSCHNO` read `X'0056'` -- only a real interrupt stores
    #     that -- and the same interrupt stored `IOINTPRM = 00000000`.
    #
    #     The device address is the right value to carry, not the IOBLOK
    #     address, because it makes all FOUR of DMKIOT's existing comparisons

    DMKEIG is the extended-logout analyser for 2860/2870/2880 channels.  It
    walks six words of I/O extended logout looking for a channel that has
    logged out, then reads LW0-LW27 -- the 2880's logout format -- to decide
    whether the failure is retryable.  None of that survives: the channel
    subsystem reports failures as subchannel status in the IRB, with the ESW
    and ERW carrying what little detail there is, and there is no per-channel
    logout area at all.

    So the analysis cannot be converted, only replaced, and replacing it is
    not M1 work.  R-03's recorded mitigation is to stub every logout site to
    a permanent error so the path assembles and fails loudly, and DMKEIG
    already has exactly that path: its own "extended logout pointer is zero"
    exit goes to CLEANUP, which sets ENTSW,TERMSYS -- system termination --
    and returns without dereferencing R1.  Taking it needs one branch.

    """DMKIOG's channel survey issues STIDC, which ESA/390 does not have.

    This is the find that justified reading the module instead of renaming
    its six symbols: `STIDC` is `GENx370x___x___` in Hercules' opcode table,
    S/370 mode only, so the survey loop would take an operation exception on
    each of sixteen channels during CP initialisation.  Assembling cleanly
    would have hidden it until the first IPL.

    The fix is again the module's own path.  Before issuing STIDC the code
    sets R0 to F's and the channel-table byte to X'FF' "tentatively ... STIDC
    FAILS", and `BNZ STIDCSAV` takes that path on a non-zero condition code.
    Branching straight there reports every channel as unidentified, which is
    the truth: the channel subsystem does not expose channels this way.  R4
    is recomputed from R5 at the top of the loop, R8 and R9 are dead after
    it, and STIDCSAV stores R0 -- still F's -- into RCHSTIDC.

    One consequence is worth having in writing, because the outstanding
    DMKIOS work depends on it: RCHTYPE's RCH370 flag is only ever reset on
    the 2860/2870/2880 paths, which are now unreachable, so RCH370 stays set
    for every channel.  Both of its consumers are HDV sites in DMKIOS, and
    both now statically take the "let the channel do the work" branch.  That
    is the branch we want under HSCH, so it simplifies M1 step 4 rather than
    complicating it.  I-40.

    The three remaining sites are stores into PSA fields the rename kept, so
    they need the new names and no other change: X'FF' into a reserved byte
    and a zero pointer, neither of which anything reads any more.

    DMKCCH analyses two different S/370 reporting mechanisms and has a natural
    termination path for each, so almost all of this is renaming rather than
    stubbing.

    `CCHRESTO` (00530000) needs nothing at all beyond the new names.  It loads
    the extended-logout pointer and does `BZ CPTERM` -- put the system down --
    and after XA0009DK that pointer is always zero, because DMKIOG's only
    store into it is `ST R1,S370IOEL` with R1 = 0 on every reachable path.  It
    then dispatches on `MCHMODEL` through `B CCHSEREP(R3)` whose entry 0 is
    also `B CPTERM`, and `MCHMODEL` is NOMODEL under any CPU the model table
    does not list.  Two independent routes to the same correct answer, both
    already written.

    `INTEGRAT` (00340000) is the one that needs a branch.  It tests the Limited
    Channel Logout in the ECSW -- validity bit, log-stored bit, channel-reset
    bit -- and those bits are now stale bytes in a reserved PSA field, so it
    would reach a decision from noise.  Its own `CCHSYSM` sets `ENTSW,TERMSYS`,
    and the code below CCHSYSM then falls through CCHIOER and CCHFAIL to
    `RCUSCN1` -- which is exactly the flow 00327000 uses for a termination
    that has already been decided.  So `B CCHSYSM` reuses the module's own
    path and invents no control flow.  What it copies into the CCH record on
    the way is a record field nobody acts on, not a decision.

    The two sites at 00780400 and 00801000 are GUEST lowcore, like DMKDSP's
    and DMKPRV's: `MVC ECSWLOG-PSA(4,R2)` is commented "ECSW TO USER", and
    00801000 is followed by `TM VMVCR14,VMIOLOG` -- the *user's* control
    register 14 I/O logout mask.  An S/370 guest still has an ECSW and a
    logout pointer at its own X'A8' and X'AC', so these keep their meaning and

    CP mimicking the hardware: in BC mode the I/O interruption code lives in
    the PSW, in EC mode at X'BA', and DMKVMI writes the IPL device address into
    whichever one the mode uses so that later code can find it where a real

    Nothing about ESA/390 requires that, and CP already has the right field:

    set by `DMKCPI` at its seq 00484000 and read by six other places including

    """M1 step 5: the I/O interrupt entry reads the interruption parameter.

    All ten sites treat `INTTIO` as a 16-bit device address -- compared against
    `IOBRADD` to match a queued IOBLOK, and against the primary and alternate
    console addresses.  ESA/390 presents no device address at interrupt time:
    the hardware stores the subsystem ID at X'B8' and the **interruption
    parameter** at X'BC', and `TSCH` yields the IRB.

    The interruption parameter is CP's to choose, which is the whole trick.
    Hercules shows the flow plainly: `SSCH` copies the ORB's intparm into the
    subchannel (`channel.c`, `memcpy(dev->pmcw.intparm, orb->intparm, ...)`),
    `MSCH` sets it from the SCHIB (`io.c:284`), and every I/O interruption
    presents it from there (`FETCH_FW(*ioparm, dev->pmcw.intparm)`).  It lives
    in the subchannel, so it is delivered on unsolicited interruptions too, not
    only on ones CP started.

    So CP puts the real device address in the low half of each subchannel's
    interruption parameter and reads it back at X'BC'+2.  Ten sites become a
    displacement change, every existing device-address comparison keeps working,
    and `DMKSCNRU` lookups are untouched.

    This deck is therefore only half of step 5: it is correct once something
    sets the parameter, and until then it reads a field nobody writes.  The
    other half is DMKCPI's discovery loop -- `STSCH` each subchannel, then
    `MSCH` to set `PMCW5_E` and the intparm together, filling `RDEVSSID` on the
    way.  Enable and intparm go in one `MSCH` because a subchannel reset clears
    both (`channel.c` zeroes intparm beside `PMCW5_E`), so they must always be
    re-established together.

    A better design exists and is deliberately not taken here: putting the
    RDEVBLOK address in the parameter instead would hand the interrupt handler
    its control block directly and remove a `DMKSCNRU` scan per interruption.
    That changes control flow at each site; the device address is a drop-in.
    Recorded so the cheaper structure is not mistaken for the best one.

def dmkcpi():
    """M1 step 6: the CR6 gate, and subchannel discovery.

    Two changes, and the first is the more important because nothing would have
    diagnosed it.

    **CR6.**  `CTLREGS` is DMKCPI's control-register image, loaded by
    `LCTL C0,C14,CTLREGS` at seq 00461000.  Its CR2 is `X'FFFFFFFF'` -- the
    S/370 channel-mask register, all thirty-two channels enabled -- and CR6 sits
    inside `DC 11F'0'`, so it is zero.  Under ESA/390 CR6 is the
    **I/O-interruption subclass mask**, and a zero mask means no subclass is
    enabled, which means no I/O interruption is ever presented.  CP would IPL,
    issue a perfectly good SSCH, and wait forever.  Nothing in the assembly or
    the instruction stream hints at it; this is the third of the three silent
    gates.  So the channel mask moves out of CR2 and becomes an ISC mask in CR6.

    CR2 is set to zero rather than left alone, because in ESA/390 it is the
    dispatchable-unit-control-table origin and `X'FFFFFFFF'` is not a value any
    of that wants to see.

    **Discovery.**  The loop probes subchannels 0 upward with `STSCH`, and for
    each one that is provided and valid, takes the device number from the PMCW,
    finds its RDEVBLOK, records the subsystem ID in `RDEVSSID`, and `MSCH`es the
    subchannel to enable it and set the interruption parameter.

    That fills in what `XA0012DK` reads: DMKIOT gets the device address back at
    `IOINTPRM+2` on every interruption, solicited or not.  Enable and parameter
    go in one `MSCH` because a subchannel reset clears both.

    Register choice is dictated by DMKSCNRU's documented conventions -- "GPR 1 =
    DEVICE ADDRESS ... GPR 0, 2-5, & 9-13 ARE NOT USED", and it uses neither
    TEMPSAVE nor BALRSAVE, so it is safe to call this early and safe to call in
    a loop holding state in R2 and R3.

    The probe is bounded rather than stopping at the first gap.  Hercules numbers
    subchannels densely from zero (`config.c`: `dev->subchan =
    sysblk.highsubchan[lcss]++`), so an early exit would work today, but a gap
    would silently truncate the device table and that is not a failure worth
    risking to save a few hundred instructions at IPL.

    #
    # CP measures main storage by pointing the program-new PSW at CPIPINT and
    # walking SSK upward until it takes an ADDRESSING exception; R5 at the
    # exception is the size, stored into DMKSYSRM.  SSK is one of the twelve
    # System/370 instructions 370-XA withdrew -- SA22-7201-08 Appendix F gives
    # it `-` against `B` for SSKE -- so under ESA/390 the FIRST SSK takes an
    # OPERATION exception instead, lands on CPIPINT, which is the loop's own
    # designed exit, and stores R5 = 0.  CP then believes it has no real
    # storage, marks all 4096 pages offline, and FRELOOP runs away over the
    # nucleus.  Nothing reports anything, because the exception IS the exit.
    # I-104.
    #
    # SSKE is the 4 KB counterpart and takes the same two registers, so the
    # instruction is a straight swap and ONE card is the whole change.
    #
    # The 2048 step at 00594000 is deliberately left alone.  ESA/390 has one
    # key per 4 KB block where S/370 had one per 2 KB, so stepping by a page
    # looked tidier -- and `LA R5,4096(,R5)` does not assemble: a
    # base-displacement offset is twelve bits, so X'1000' earns
    # `IFO208 DISPLACEMENT GREATER THAN X'FFF'`.  2048 is the largest step
    # this addressing mode allows, which is presumably why IBM wrote it.
    # Stepping 2048 against 4 KB keys sets each key twice -- redundant rather
    # than wrong, exactly as `23-STORAGE-KEYS.md` found for DMKPTR -- and the
    # `LTR`/`BNZ` wrap test at 16 MB is unaffected, because milestone A runs
    # AMODE 24 so R5 still wraps there.
    #
    # The probe itself is kept rather than replaced by a store of DMKSYSRV.
    # Reading the sysgen constant would be simpler and would be wrong the
    # moment MAINSIZE is smaller than RMSIZE -- which is exactly the case
    # this loop exists to detect.

    #     refuses to start without it.  `TIMETEST` reads location X'50',
    #     polls it 40,000 times for a change, writes "Turn on the Interval
    #     Timer" and branches back to poll again -- 181,775 times in one run
    #     before the harness stopped it.
    #
    #     The authority is the same PoO table that justified I-174 and I-175.
    #     Appendix F, "Comparison between System/370 and 370-XA", lists the
    #     assigned-storage locations that differ, and three of this project's
    #     defects are one row each:
    #
    #       Channel-status word         64 (X'40')  ->  gone    I-175
    #       Channel-address word        72 (X'48')  ->  gone    still open
    #       Interval timer              80 (X'50')  ->  gone    this
    #       Subsystem ID                gone -> 184 (X'B8')     I-174
    #       I/O-interruption parameter  gone -> 188 (X'BC')     I-174
    #
    #     CR0 bit 24, the interval-timer subclass mask, goes with it.
    #
    #     So the test cannot be satisfied and must not be run.  Only the
    #     `EQU *` is replaced: `TLOOP1`, `TLOOP` and `NOMPMSG` stay defined
    #     because cards below still branch to them, and the dead loop costs
    #     nothing.  `B TIMETEST` at 02700000 is the only branch in.
    #
    #     This is NOT "timing is gone". The CPU timer and clock comparator
    #     are ESA/390 facilities and CP already uses `STPT`/`SPT` in the
    #     dispatcher. What is gone is the location-X'50' interval timer, and
    #     CP reads it elsewhere -- DMKSCH and DMKDSP most of all -- so the
    #     accounting and time-slicing that depend on it are a separate and
    #     larger piece of work. Clearing the start-up gate does not fix them.

    * The probe (`KEYLOOP`, SSKE upward by 2 KB until an addressing
      exception) ran in AMODE 24 -- DMKCPI's initialisation does until its
      first interrupt (I-224) -- so `LA R5,2048(,R5)` wrapped at 16 MB and
      `L R5,=X'01000000'` stored 16 MB whatever Hercules had.  It now runs
      AMODE 31.  The exception's new PSW is `A(CPIPINT)` with bit 32 off, so
      CPIPINT is back in AMODE 24 with the size in R5.
    * The CORTABLE (16 bytes per 4 KB frame) was SYSCOR's static table in
      DMKSYS, sized by RMSIZE (at most 16392K).  DMKCPIB builds one for all
      of real storage at the top of the low 16 MB, stores its origin in
      ACORETBL (the PSA word every module loads it from), marks its own
      frames as system frames and every frame above 16 MB offline ('*OL*',
      as CP marks storage beyond RMSIZE), and stores the low region below
      the table as DMKSYSRV -- the size the rest of DMKCPI lays out free
      storage, the trace table and the dynamic area in.  DMKSYSRM keeps the
      real size: QUERY STORAGE and every bounds check see all of it.  The
      static table and the CP-assist lists that point at it (DMKCCW, DMKFRE,
      DMKPTR) are dead on ESA/390; DMKDMP's DMPCORET still names it (I-201).
    * The dump file is sized from DMKSYSRV, not DMKSYSRM: at 2 GB it would
      be 512K spool records.

    Frames above the line hold no guest page and no CP data, so nothing that
    keeps a real address in 24 bits (CCWs, control-block fields with a flag
    in byte 0 -- docs/38-M4B-REAL2G.md) can ever see one.  Instead they are
    page SLOTS, as a paging device's are: DMKPGTPG hands one out before any
    DASD slot, DMKPAG moves the page with MVCL instead of an I/O, and the
    page comes back into a frame below the line on the next page fault.
    This is what VM/XA did with expanded storage.

    A slot's CCPD (SWPCYL/SWPDPAGE/SWPCODE) is CYL = slot/128, PAGE =
    slot//128 + 1 (never 0, which means 'never written'), CODE = X'FF'
    (no OWNDLIST entry; the owned list has at most a few dozen).  Slot n is
    the frame at 16 MB + n*4096.  Allocation pops a free stack threaded
    through the free frames themselves (CP runs AMODE 31) or takes the next
    never-used frame; release pushes.  A slot counts as a drum page
    (VMPDRUM), and every place that finds the device of a slot to keep the
    drum/disk counters -- DMKPGT, DMKPGS, DMKATS, DMKCPP -- or to decide
    on arm optimisation -- DMKPTR -- treats code X'FF' as a drum.

def dmksys():
    """Run uniprocessor, so DMKCPI's CONCS loop never executes.

    `CONCS` connects a channel set to a processor.  It is S/370-only, it is
    hand-coded as `DC X'B2001000'` so no sweep of the opcode column sees it
    (I-49), and `DMKCPI` executes it in a loop over sixty-four channel-set
    addresses -- but only when `DMKSYSAP` says `Y`.  Which it does, because
    `OPTIONS.COPY` sets `&AP SETB 1` via `HRC035DK` and DMKSYS's
    `AIF (NOT &AP).E1` therefore assembles the `AP=YES` line.  I-50.

    Forcing the flag is the cheapest of the three available levers, and it is
    worth being explicit about why, because the three are often confused:

      * `&AP` in `OPTIONS.COPY` is assembly-wide.  `CALL`, `LOCK`, `SIGNAL`,
        `SWITCH`, `COUNT`, `CHARGE` and `PSA` all declare `GBLB &AP`, so
        changing it re-expands macros in **every** module and invalidates every
        TEXT deck built so far.  Not touched.
      * The load list is chosen at `VMFLOAD` time with no re-assembly at all --
        `CPLOAD` (173) or `APLOAD` (181, which adds DMKCPP and DMKMCT and four
        more CONCS/DISCS sites).
      * `DMKSYSAP` is `DC CL1'&AP1'` -- literally one character, 'Y' or 'N', in
        one module.  This deck replaces the conditional pair with the AP=NO
        line, so one re-assembly of DMKSYS settles it.

    Eight modules read `DMKSYSAP` at runtime -- DMKATS, DMKCDB, DMKCDM, DMKCDS,
    DMKCFG, DMKCPI, DMKCPU, DMKPGS -- so every AP-sensitive path already has a
    uniprocessor branch.  `AP=NO` is a configuration IBM supported, not a
    degradation we are inventing.

    It also matches the machine: CE's Hercules configuration is `NUMCPU 1`, so
    AP support cannot do anything useful today in any case.

    **Reverting** costs one re-assembly of DMKSYS and a nucleus rebuild: drop
    this deck from `DMKSYS AUXLCL`.  Nothing else done for the conversion has to
    be undone.  What re-enabling AP on ESA/390 *would* need is a redesign rather
    than a deck, and that is the honest caveat: channel sets do not exist in the
    channel subsystem, where every CPU can address every subchannel, so CP's
    model of moving I/O ownership between processors is obsolete rather than
    broken.  The processor half survives untouched -- `SIGP`, `SPX`, `STPX`,
    `STAP` and `SPT` are all `GENx370x390x900` -- so multiprocessing is
    reachable later; it is the I/O half that would be new work.

    """The first bootstrap module: checkpoint and shutdown.

    Twenty-three channel sites, all in polled loops, converted through the XAIO
    macros so the condition-code reasoning stays in one place.  Three separate
    hazard classes meet in this one module, which is why it was worth reading
    rather than pattern-matching:

      * `INTTIO` four times, in both of its roles (I-47): 00208000 reads the IPL
        device address DMKVMI left, 00274370 copies `SYSIPLDV` into the
        architected slot for no reason ESA/390 recognises, and 00772000 and
        01495500 read what the hardware stored.
      * Absolute lowcore three times (I-53): `MVC SAVEDEV(4),184` twice and
        `MVC 184(4),SAVEDEV` once -- a save and restore of the interruption
        information around DMKCKP's own I/O.  X'B8' is four bytes of
        key/flags/device address in S/370 and eight of subsystem ID plus
        interruption parameter in ESA/390, so `SAVEDEV` widens to two fullwords
        and the moves become symbolic.
      * Sixteen backward self-relative branches that span a converted
        instruction (R-26), each becoming a label **in this deck**.  The other
        twenty-six in the module are forward branches over unconverted code and
        are correct as they stand; they belong to the 64-bit pass, which has the
        list in `tools/selfrel.py`.

    Three things deliberately left alone, each worth stating because leaving
    them alone is a decision:

      * The `ST Rx,CAW` stores.  The CAW is now an ordinary word of CP's
        storage, and `XASIO` reads the CCW address straight out of it, so every
        one of those stores keeps working and the diff stays small.
      * The `CLC CSW+4(2),=AL1(CE+DE,0)` tests and `MVC SAVECSW(12),CSW`.
        `XATIO` rebuilds a CSW at the architected location from the IRB, so all
        the status logic is untouched -- which is most of the module.
      * `CCW X'08',*-8-DMKCKP+X'800',0,0` at 00460000, 00467000 and 00475000.
        These are self-relative **CCWs**, not branches, and with format-0 CCWs
        (R-27) the layout and the eight-byte length are both unchanged, so a
        TIC pointing back eight bytes still points at the previous CCW.

    # so it would have been erased at runtime with no diagnostic at all.  I-55.

    # `USING DMKCKPT,R12,R13`, R12 = X'800' and R13 = X'1800' -- and the IPL
    # record reads only the FIRST 4096 bytes.  The second 4096 arrive later,
    # via `LDCCW  CCW 6,0+X'1800',CC+SILI,4096` at 00476000 -- a read that is

    **Five of the seventeen branches are free.**  `TIOIPL`, `DRAINEND`,
    `DOMONSIO`, `DOTIO` and `GOTIO` already label the instruction their `*-4`
    targets, so the branch only needs the name it could have used all along.

    **Placement is easy here.**  DMKDMP's only clears are `XC SENSDATA(24)` --
    a named field -- and an `MVCL` over real pages 1 to 3, which is storage
    rather than the module.  So `XAIOWORK` goes at the end of the data, after the
    closing `ORG`, with none of the `CLR1` trouble DMKCKP gave (I-55).

    The lookup's `STSCH` scan rather than `RDEVSSID` earns its keep in exactly
    this module: DMKDMP runs *after an abend*, when CP's control blocks are the
    one thing that cannot be trusted, and a dump that needs a healthy RDEVBLOK

    #
    #     ISKE is a drop-in for all four, and that is checked rather than
    #     assumed.  SA22-7201-08: ISKE inserts "the seven-bit storage key in
    #     bit positions 24-30 of general register R1, and bit 31 is set to
    #     zero.  The contents of bit positions 0-23 of the register remain
    #     unchanged" -- the same result format ISK produces, so every
    #     following `STC` is unaffected.  (Not to be confused with IVSK on the
    #     facing page, which returns only ACC and F in bits 24-28.)  The
    #     operand differs only in granularity: in 24-bit mode ISKE takes
    #     "bits 8-19 of general register R2" and ignores bits 20-31, where ISK
    #     reads a 2 KB block, so an address anywhere in a page answers for the
    #     page.
    #
    #     Every one of these four loops walks storage in 2 KB steps and stores
    #     one key byte per step.  Under ISKE both halves of a page return that
    #     page's key, so each pair of slots holds the same value -- which is
    #     the truth under 4 KB keys, and CE already runs with them on
    #     (`CPCREG0 DC X'81800CC0'`).  Redundant, not wrong: exactly I-104's
    #     finding about DMKCPI's SSK.  So the steps, the loop counts and the
    #     SAVKEY layout are all left alone, and each site is ONE card.
    #     Widening the steps would change the dump's own key table, which is a
    #     format change masquerading as an architecture fix.
    #
    #     Knowing deviation: Hercules marks ISKE GENx370x390x900 and so accepts
    #     it in S/370 mode, but a real S/370 would not -- ISKE arrived with
    #     370-XA.  These cards are therefore unconditional, with no architecture
    #     probe, and the converted nucleus is an ESA/390 artifact that happens
    #     to also run under Hercules's S/370.  That is the standing

    00613100, 00613300) must therefore stay `SIO` and `TIO`, and `00430000`'s
    `BC 7,*-4` stays with them because the instruction it spans is unchanged.

    The six sites at 00149100 to 00166090 are on the IPL and restore side, which
    runs on the **target** machine in ESA/390 mode, and those are converted.  A
    module holding both is not a contradiction: the two paths are never executed
    in the same IPL.  I-59.

    No `INTTIO`, no absolute lowcore, and **no `XC` or `MVCL` anywhere in the
    module** -- so unlike `DMKCKP` there is no cleared region for `XAIOWORK` to
    avoid (I-55).  It has
    `USING PSA,R0` and `COPY EQU`, so `CAW`, `CSW` and the register equates all
    resolve and no `XAIOWORK` parameters are needed.

    Four sites were invisible to a first scan because the label in columns 1-8 is
    the mnemonic itself -- `SIO SIO 0(R10)`, `QDISK`, `SNSRTSIO`, `SNSRTTIO`.  A
    scan keyed on the operation field finds them; one keyed on leading whitespace
    does not.  Three of those four turn out to be DMKSAVNC's and are left alone;
    the `SIO` label survives conversion unchanged, and `BC 7,*-4` becomes
    `BC 7,SIO`, which reads oddly and is correct.

    The one thing to watch is size.  `USING DMKSAV,R3` is a **single** base
    register, so the module has 4 KB of addressability rather than the 8 KB that
    `DMKDMP` had when it overflowed (I-56).  Eleven sites at fourteen bytes plus
    the work area is about 550 bytes of growth; the module is small, so it should
    fit, but this is the module where a compact call site matters most.

    # An enabled wait for an I/O interrupt is the ONE place DMKSAV does not
    # poll, and three separate things break it under ESA/390, not one:
    #
    #   * XWAIT is a BC-mode PSW (see the constants below -- but that is only
    #     the first of the three).
    #   * Interrupt delivery is gated by CR6, the I/O-interruption subclass
    #     mask.  DMKSAV instead builds a channel mask from the device address
    #     and sets CR2 (00418300-00418600, @VA11715) -- the S/370 EC-mode
    #     channel-mask register, which in ESA/390 is not that register at all.
    #     The tC trace shows CR6 = 00000000, so the interrupt would never
    #     arrive and a corrected XWAIT would have waited for ever.
    #   * `CH 10,IOOPSW+2` tests the device address the BC-mode hardware
    #     leaves in the I/O old PSW's interruption-code field at X'3A'.  EC
    #     mode puts it at X'BA' and ESA/390 does not supply one at all -- an
    #     I/O interruption gives a subsystem ID at X'B8' and an IRB via TSCH.
    #
    # So the interrupt-driven shape needs four coupled changes to work.
    # Polling needs none: XATIO already handles both architectures, and its
    # shim rebuilds a CSW at the architected location from the IRB, so the
    # `CLC CSW+4(2)` that follows each wait keeps working untouched.  It is
    # also what the rest of DMKSAV already does -- the wait is the odd one
    # out, not the pattern.

    """The guest's CLEAR CHANNEL, which stops being passed through to hardware.

    `DMKVSJ` simulates the guest's `HIO` and `CLCH`.  When the virtual channel is
    **dedicated** -- `VCHSTAT` has `VCHDED`, set only by `DMKVCH`'s
    `ATTACH CHANNEL` at seq 00570000 -- CP hands the guest's `CLCH` straight to
    the hardware as a real `CLRCH`, hand-assembled because Assembler XF has no
    such mnemonic:

        00169000  BNO   CLCHEXIT       NO, TREAT CLCH AS A TCH
        00170000  SWITCH               MAKE SURE WE ARE ON I/O PROC
        00171000  LH    R1,VCHADD      GET CHANNEL ADDR - REAL=VIRTUAL
        00172000* CLRCH 0(R1)          ISSUE REAL CLRCH INSTRUCTION
        00173000  DC    X'9F01'        ISSUE REAL CLRCH INSTRUCTION
        00174000  DC    S(0(1))        FOR SPECIFIED CHANNEL

    This is the last live DC-encoded channel instruction in the nucleus, the
    other being `DMKCPI`'s `CONCS`, which `AP=NO` already makes dead (`I-50`).
    It is also the one site in the whole conversion where the right answer is to
    **delete the function rather than convert it**, and it took three findings
    to be sure of that.

    **`RCHP` is not the successor of `CLRCH`.**  X'B23B' is `GENx___x390x900`, so
    it exists exactly where `CLRCH` does not, which makes it look like the
    substitution.  It is not: it resets a *channel path*, which in ESA/390 is a
    shared resource the channel subsystem owns, not a channel a guest can be
    given.  VM/XA dropped dedicated channels for this reason.

    **The obvious conversion program-checks.**  `RCHP` takes its CHPID in R1
    bits 24-31 and takes an operand exception if bits 0-23 are non-zero
    (`io.c`: `if(regs->GR_L(1) & 0xFFFFFF00) program_interrupt(OPERAND)`).
    `VCHADD` is a channel address in device-number form -- X'0300' for channel
    3 -- so `LH R1,VCHADD` followed by `RCHP` is an operand exception every
    time.  A shift would silence that, and Hercules even assigns
    `chpid = devnum >> 8` (`config.c:724`), so it would appear to work.

    **And appearing to work is the trap.**  `chp_reset` calls `device_reset` on
    every device on the path, and `device_reset` is the one thing that clears
    `PMCW5_E` and the interruption parameter (`docs/24-INTTIO.md`).  CP sets both
    exactly once, at IPL, in `XA0013DK`, and has no code anywhere that re-enables
    a subchannel -- so a single guest `CLCH` would permanently disable every
    device on that channel, and SSCH would return cc3 for the rest of the IPL
    with no diagnostic.  `chp_reset` then queues a channel report
    (`build_chp_reset_chrpt`), and CP has no channel-report machinery at all.

    So the pass-through goes.  `CLCH` is now always simulated as a `TCH`, which
    is what this module already did for every channel that was not dedicated --
    the `BNO CLCHEXIT` one instruction earlier.  `DMKVSICH` documents its entry
    contract as "ALL OTHER REGISTERS CONTAIN THE SAME VALUES THAT THEY HAD IN
    DMKVSJ", and nothing between 00165000 and 00169000 alters a register, so
    taking that branch unconditionally is state-identical to taking it on the
    `BNO`.  `I-62`.

    The whole block 00168000-00195000 is replaced rather than left dead, so no
    `CLRCH` remains in the nucleus for a later reader to find.  Three things make
    that safe: `CCTRACE` at 00177000 is referenced from nowhere in CP -- it is
    already a dead label -- `CLRCHNOT` is referenced only from inside the block,
    and the `AIF`/`ANOP` pair at 00175000/00188000 is entirely within the range,
    so the conditional assembly is removed as a unit.  `&TRACE(9) SETB 1` in
    `OPTIONS.COPY`, so it was live code, not skipped text.

    `DMKVSJCC` at 00162000 keeps counting virtual `CLCH`s, so nothing a monitor
    or `Q STAT` reads changes.  The module has no renamed PSA symbol and no
    column-scan channel instruction, so this deck is the whole of its work.

    #     `LH R5,CSW+4` -- it reads the architected CSW and hands the status to

def dmkopr():
    """The operator console writer -- and therefore CP's only voice.

    `DMKOPR` is `DMKOPRWT`, the routine every other module calls to put a line
    on the operator's console.  Three channel sites, all in one routine:

        00142000  TIO 0(R3)   CLEAR ANY OUTSTANDING STATUS
        00149000  SIO 0(R3)   ISSUE SIO
        00153000  TIO 0(R3)   WAIT FOR DEVICE END STATUS

    This is the module to convert next for a reason beyond its size.  Every
    bootstrap failure so far has been diagnosed by instruction trace, because
    `I-94` left CP unable to report anything: the error paths in `DMKCKP` and
    `DMKCPI` call `DMKOPRWT`, and `DMKOPRWT` could not drive the device.  A
    working console turns the next wall from a PSW and a storage dump into a
    message with a number on it.

    The condition-code contract is the reason `XATIO` drops in unchanged.
    The code reads `TIO`'s S/370 codes directly -- `BO SETCC3` for cc3 not
    operational, `BC 4+2,TESTLOOP` for cc1 or cc2 -- and then reads the CSW
    with `TM CSW+4,UC`.  `XATIO` presents exactly those four codes and its
    shim rebuilds the CSW at the architected location from the IRB, so both
    survive.  `SIO`'s condition code is never tested here at all.

    `USING DMKOPRWT,R15` is a **single** base, so the module has 4 KB of
    addressability and the work area has to fit inside it -- the same
    constraint that `I-56` hit in `DMKDMP` and that `dmksav` notes.  If it
    does not fit the assembler says so, which is the cheap failure.

    Placement sharpens `I-77`.  That issue said to anchor before the `PSA`
    macro, and copying that rule here put the work area at `COPY EQU`
    (00277000) and earned **81** `IFO209 ADDRESSABILITY ERROR`s.  The tail of
    this module is

        00274000  LTORG
        00275000  EJECT
        00276000  COPY RBLOKS      <- RCHBLOK DSECT, and it never returns
        00277000  COPY EQU
        00278000  COPY DEVTYPES
        00279000  PSA
        00280000  END DMKOPR

    `COPY RBLOKS` opens a DSECT and does not close it, so everything after it
    -- `COPY EQU`, `COPY DEVTYPES`, the `PSA` macro and anything inserted
    among them -- is already inside a dummy section.  The real rule is
    therefore **anchor before the first COPY that opens a DSECT**, not before
    the `PSA` macro; in `DMKSAV` those happened to be the same statement,
    which is why the narrower rule survived.  The anchor here is the `EJECT`
    at 00275000, the last statement still in the CSECT.  I-105.

    The two `XC`s in this module -- `XC CSW,CSW` and `XC MSGBUF(160),MSGBUF`
    -- are both bounded and neither reaches the work area, so `I-55` does not
    apply.

    `USING DMKPSA,R0` and `PSA EQU DMKPSA`: the module *is* the prefix storage
    area, addressed from absolute zero.  It declares REENTRANT, and unlike
    `DMKIOT` and `DMKCNS` it has **no** `USING IOBLOK`, so `XAIOB`'s
    IOBLOK-resident storage is not available and neither macro set fits.

    What the two sites actually need turns out to be much less than either
    macro provides.

    **The `HIO` at 00646000 needs no storage at all.**  `HSCH` takes its
    subchannel in R1 and writes nothing, so it is two instructions and is
    reentrant by construction.  R1 is safe to clobber: `CALL DMKSCNRD` set it
    before the loop, nothing between here and `EXTEXIT` reads it, and each
    iteration reloads it from `RDEVSSID` anyway.

    **The `TIO` at 00651000 has no CSW test and no condition-code test after
    it** -- `BCT R15,HALTCON` is the next instruction.  Its whole purpose is to
    consume pending status, so the IRB `TSCH` stores into is **write-only**:
    nothing ever reads it.  That is what makes a shared scratch area correct
    here rather than merely convenient, because two paths racing on it would
    both be discarding what they wrote.  It is the one case in this conversion
    where reentrancy costs nothing to satisfy.

    `BC 2,*-4` at 00647000 spans the converted `HIO`, and `HALTCON` at 00645000
    already labels the target, so it only needs the name it could have used

    `DMKQCNWT` -> `DMKCNSIC` -> `DMKIOS` -> interrupt -> `DMKCNSIN` is M1's
    target, so these five sites have to be right rather than merely assemble.
    They are also the only place in the nucleus that issues `CLRIO`.

    It uses `XAIOB` for the same reason `DMKIOT` does -- `USING RDEVBLOK,R8`
    and `USING IOBLOK,R10` from the prologue, and every caller takes its device
    from `CALL DMKSCNRD`, which returns R8's own address.

    **The base registers needed checking and the answer was not obvious.**  The
    module drops R13 twice and establishes `USING DMKCNSIN,R12` and
    `USING DMKCNSEN,R12`, which looks like three addressability domains with
    the five sites split across two of them -- and one `XAIOBWRK` can only be
    assembled against one base (`I-70`).  It is not: each of those entry points
    reloads R12 and R13 from `CNSBASE` within two instructions and
    re-establishes `USING DMKCNS,R12,R13`, so the alternative `USING` covers
    only its own prologue and every site sees the same base.  The same shape as
    `DMKCPI`'s `DMKCPIEM`.

    Placement is before the `LTORG` at 01735000, after the `DC` constants at
    01709000-01724000, so nothing falls into it and it sits between the sites

    8 KB and the module already fits inside that, but the five call sites and

    **The mutual exclusion does not depend on it.**  `TS XTNDLOCK` two
    instructions earlier is the real lock, and it aborts on re-entry.  The CR2
    masking is belt and braces for channel 0 alone -- devices on other channels
    could always interrupt -- so removing it weakens a guard that was already
    partial rather than removing the guard.

    **And the obvious substitute would be worse.**  The nearest ESA/390
    equivalent is masking the I/O-interruption subclass in CR6, but every
    subchannel is ISC 0 here, so that would mask *all* I/O -- and the extend
    calls `DMKPTRFR`, which does paging I/O and waits for it.  A faithful-
    looking conversion would deadlock the very path it was protecting.  `I-73`.

#
# The second is DMKCPI's own probe at 00613000, which is DELIBERATE: it arms
# `PRNPSW+4` at `CPIPINT2` first, and `CPIPINT2` walks `CPATABLE` replacing
# every assist instruction with `MVC 0(6,R6),=X'0700,47000000'` -- six bytes of
# no-op -- so that the software path following each assist runs instead.  That
# recovery works, and it worked here on the first try.
#
# The FIRST exception is the defect, and it is an ORDERING defect: `SCNRU` sits
# at DMKSCNRU's entry (X'3F528') and DMKCPI calls it, looking up device 00C
# (GR1 = 0000000C), BEFORE it has probed.  GR5 = 0 dates it -- the storage
# sizing had not run yet.  On real hardware the order is irrelevant, because CE
# runs ECPSVM YES and the assists simply work; under ESA/390 they do not exist,
# and CP executes one before asking whether they are there.
#
# Two counts worth keeping straight, because both were got wrong first:
#
#   * 21 SOURCE SITES, not 24.  `DC X'E610'` with no operand appears in DMKGRT,
#     DMKRGA and DMKRGF and is the card-reader DEVICE TYPE constant -- data, and
#     its own comment says so.  An assist is `DC X'E6nn',S(a,b)`: six bytes,
#     opcode plus two S-type constants, which is what the trace disassembled.
#     Grepping a byte pattern without the operand test over-counts by three.
#   * 30 INSTRUCTIONS in the nucleus, not 21.  DMKCCW generates its assists from
#     macros -- `X'E608'` expands to DMKCCWB1..B8 and `X'E609'` to L1..L5 -- so
#     five source lines become sixteen instructions.  `CPATABLE` is the
#     authority, and it has exactly 30 entries.  08-MACRO-UNDERCOUNT again.
#
# CPATABLE covers all 30, so CP's runtime recovery is COMPLETE and only its
# timing is wrong.  That invites a one-module fix -- no-op DMKSCN's two sites and
# let CLEARCPA handle the other 28 -- and that is refused on purpose: it is the
# "fix the instance, miss the class" pattern this register already records three
# times, and it would leave 28 illegal instructions in the nucleus that merely
# happen not to be reached on this path.
#
# So every site is no-opped at ASSEMBLY time with the same six bytes CP writes at
# RUN time.  Labels are reproduced -- DMKDSP0, DMKDSP1, DMKDSP2, DMKVATZP,
# DMKVATZS, DMKCCW0, DMKCCW1, DMKCCWGN and the macros' `&ENTRYPT` are entry
# points, and I-107 is the reminder that a replacement card that drops its label
# leaves every reference unresolved.  Length is unchanged at six bytes, so no
# self-relative branch can span a site and shift -- R-26 does not apply.
#
# DMKCPI is the one exception and gets a BRANCH, not a no-op: no-opping its probe
# would fall through to `OI CPSTAT2,CPASTAVL+CPASTON`, declaring the assists
# available and ON and skipping CLEARCPA entirely.  `B CPIPINT2` takes the
# correct path, padded to six bytes so nothing shifts.
#
# DMKAPI's E612 is deliberately NOT converted: with AP=NO (I-50) it is not in
# CPLOAD's list.  If AP is ever re-enabled it needs the same treatment.

    """I-116.  Make the generator emit the block the DSECT describes.

    `RBLOKS.XA0002DK` added `RDEVSSID` and a reserved fullword after `RDEVIOBL`,
    the DSECT's last field, so `RDEVSIZE EQU (*-RDEVBLOK)/8` went from 11
    doublewords to 12.  But DMKRIO's blocks are not cut from the DSECT --
    `RDEVICE.MACRO` emits them as a list of explicit `DC` statements and ends at
    `DC F'0' RESERVED FOR IBM USE`, which IS `RDEVIOBL`.  So the array stayed at
    88 bytes a block while every scanner started striding 96:

        VSERNEXT LA    R1,RDEVSIZE*8(,R1)  POINT TO NEXT REAL DEVICE BLOCK

    `DMKSCNVS` therefore walks 8 bytes further out per block, cannot find the
    SYSRES volume label, and DMKCPI takes `ABEND 1 -- SYSRES DEVICE NOT FOUND OR
    INCORRECT`, reported as `CPI001`.

    **Measured, not argued.**  `tools/dumpscan.py` reads the printed abend dump
    back into a byte image and reports:

        ARIODV = 0149E8, ARIODC count = 949
        OBSERVED stride = X'58' (11 doublewords)
        CONFIRMED: 0149E8 + 949 x X'58' = 029020 = ARIOCU -- they abut exactly

    949 blocks at 88 bytes land precisely on the first RCUBLOK, which settles the
    stride beyond coincidence.  Over 949 blocks the 8-byte error accumulates to
    7592 bytes, so the scan is not slightly off, it is off the end of the array.

    **Why nothing caught it.**  Both halves are correct in isolation, they live in
    different files, and neither mentions the other -- so all 201 modules
    assemble with NO STATEMENTS FLAGGED and the only symptom is a scan reading
    the wrong addresses.  The deck's own comment said *"RESERVED, KEEPS RDEVSIZE
    EXACT"*: care was taken that `RDEVSIZE` stayed a whole number of doublewords,
    and the question of whether anything BUILT blocks to a different length was
    never asked.

    **The rejected alternative.**  `ORG`-ing `RDEVSSID` onto `RDEVIOBL` -- unused
    under AP=NO (I-50) -- would need no generator change at all and no length
    change anywhere.  It is refused because it overloads a field a future AP
    revival needs, and `dmksys()` deliberately keeps that door open: *"the
    processor half survives untouched ... multiprocessing is reachable later"*.
    Paying eight bytes a block (7592 bytes of nucleus) to keep the DSECT honest
    is the cheaper of the two debts.

    This is the module the conversion exists for.  `DMKBLDRT` writes the segment
    and page tables CP gives itself at IPL, and `TRANS`'s `LRA` reads them --
    which is `wall 11`, `PRG018`, a translation-specification exception against a
    System/370 table.  `DMKBLDRL` is its inverse and has to stay in step, which
    is most of why this deck is one deck and not two.

    `asmerr.py` says the assembler flags **37** statements here.  This deck has
    more cards than that for three reasons, and each is a class the assembler
    cannot see (`I-124`):

      * the **alignment** arithmetic -- `AL R0,F7` and the rounding it pays for
      * the **packed-pointer masks** -- `L Rn,VMSEG` followed by `LA Rn,0(,Rn)`,
        which stripped the length when it lived in the ignored high byte and
        strips nothing now that STL is bits 25-31 (`I-128`)
      * the **ABI split** -- `SRL R8,20`, `SLL R1,4+4` and five more literals
        that divide a page number into a segment and a page

    The ABI itself does not change, and the source says why.  Sequence 00523000:

        *        GPR 1 = BEGINING AND ENDING ADDRESS TO RELEASE
        *        BYTE 0-1 = FIRST ADDRESS TO RELEASE
        *             FIRST 4 BITS = 0, NEXT 8 BITS = SEGMENT, NEXT 4 = PAGE

    Twelve bits of page number, split 8+4 for 64 KB segments and 4+8 for 1 MB
    ones.  **The field keeps its width and its meaning; only the split moves.**
    `SLL R1,4+4  SEGMENT COUNT * 16` is written as a sum because the two shifts
    mean different things -- units to segments, then segments to pages -- so only
    the second becomes 8.  Written as `SLL R1,8` it would have been impossible to
    convert by reading, and `R01-SHIFT-SITES.md`'s "4 -> 8" rule would have

#
# System/370 keys cover 2 KB, so CP keys a 4 KB page as TWO halves and keeps
# TWO key bytes per page in the swap table -- `SWPKEY1  VIRTUAL STORAGE KEY,
# 1ST 2048 BYTES` and `SWPKEY2 ... 2ND 2048 BYTES`.  The ESA/390 PoO gives the
# 370-XA facilities "key-controlled protection on only 4K-byte blocks", so each
# pair of `SSK`s becomes one `SSKE` and the arithmetic that moved from one key
# byte to the other goes with it.  That is I-128's structural law again: S/370
# packed two things where ESA/390 has one slot.
#
# This is a SEPARATE deck from the DAT work even though DMKPTR carries both,
# because the two axes fail differently and a bisect wants them apart: DAT
# errors give a plausible wrong address, a missed key gives an operation
# exception at a named instruction.
#
# `ISKE`, `SSKE` and `RRBE` are already in XAOPS.MACRO and already proven by
# execution in `11-storage-keys.rc`, and `DMKCPI.XA0013DK` has been running an
# `SSKE` since I-104.  So this is not new ground, only unfinished ground.

    # The mnemonic-only sites, and the reason there are so many of them.
    #
    # The half-page idiom is always `op Rx,Ry` / `LA Ry,2048(,Ry)` /
    # `op Rx,Ry`.  The second operand still names the SAME 4 KB page -- 2048
    # is inside it -- and ISKE and SSKE take their block from bits 1-19 and
    # IGNORE bits 20-31, where ISK and SSK required bits 29-31 to be zero or
    # took a specification exception.  So under ESA/390 the second operation
    # reads or writes the same key byte as the first.
    #
    # For a READ pair that makes the second ISKE a redundant repeat: it returns
    # the same key and sets the same condition code, so the pair is
    # behaviour-preserving with nothing but the mnemonic changed, and any mask
    # that tests both byte positions -- DMKVMA's CHGBITS of X'00000202',
    # DMKMCH's =A(X'202') -- still works, because the register now holds the
    # same key in both halves.  For a WRITE pair it depends on where the two
    # written values come from: if they are the same byte, as in DMKCDS, the
    # second SSKE rewrites what the first wrote; if a shift sits between them,
    # as in DMKCCW and DMKDGD, they are DIFFERENT bytes of a packed halfword
    # and the pair must genuinely collapse.

# CE's `HRC370DK` probes for System/380 -- a program-check trap around a `BSM`
# -- and when the probe succeeds it zaps a C'8' over the C'7' of "VM/370" in
# three separate literals, so the system announces itself as VM/380.
#
# This project is not taking that route.  It is a 31-bit ESA/390 conversion on
# the way to 64-bit, so the name is **VM/370plus**.  The probe is left in place
# because it records a true fact about the machine in `INSTWRD1` byte 0, but
# nothing may paint that byte over a banner.  Byte 0 is display-only; bytes 1-3
# hold the LDEVCTL pointer used by DMKCFP, DMKGRF and HDKD7C, and `MVI` writes
# only byte 0, so removing the three readers changes no behaviour at all.
#
# DMKCPI's console banner and DMKCNS's "VM/370 Online" are handled in their own
# decks, where the literal and its zap sit in one module.  DMKGRF is different:
# its two zaps write into 3270 logo SCREEN DATA at fixed displacements rather
# than into a named literal, so they are removed and the logo keeps whatever the
# screen tables already say.  Putting the `+` into the logo itself needs the
# FMT77 screen layout and is deliberately left for later -- the point here is
# that nothing says /380 any more, not that everything says /370+.

# DMKCFG adopted the user's own page table for each shared 64 KB segment as
# the shared one, later users swapped theirs for it, and the segment table
# entry was the unit of sharing.  With 1 MB segments that would make the
# whole megabyte common -- CMS keeps private nucleus pages in the same
# megabyte as its shared ones (F00000-F7FFFF private, F80000-FAFFFF shared)
# -- which is wall 24, I-195.  Here the SHRTABLE's page tables are MODELS,
# never placed in a user's STE: each user keeps a private 256-entry table
# for the segment, and DMKCFG copies the model's 16 PTEs and 16 swap entries
# per shared 64 KB group into it.  The model's frames are brought in once,
# through the first user's address space with the model in the STE for the
# duration of sixteen TRANS BRING+LOCK, and stay locked (CORIOLCK) while the
# named system is resident, so no sharer's PTE copy can go stale; they are
# owned by SYSTEM.  The ESA/390 common-segment bit is never used.
# M2, AMODE 31, first step (I-208): CP runs AMODE 24, and LOAD REAL ADDRESS
# forms its operand address in the current mode, so every `TRANS` asked about
# a virtual address above 16 MB was answered about the address modulo 16 MB
# -- correctly, about the wrong page (README "AMODE 31 is a prerequisite").
# The fix that does not need the 215 LA-strip sites (I-126) first: switch to
# AMODE 31 for the LRA alone with BSM, and switch back.  R15 is the scratch
# register, because the macro's own non-resident path -- CALL DMKPTRAN -- has
# always returned with R15 clobbered, so no site can have depended on it.
# OR sets the condition code but runs before the LRA; LA and BSM leave it,
# so the BC that follows still sees LRA's.  In AMODE 31 LA yields bit 0 = 0,
# which is exactly what BSM needs to return to AMODE 24.  While real storage
# stays below 16 MB every CP address is a 24-bit address, so nothing else in
# CP notices; this unlocks VIRTUAL storage above the line.
# M2 step 3: a guest with PSW bit 32 on.  The dispatcher already copies an
# EC-mode guest's VMPSW+4 whole into the real PSW, so the guest RUNS in
# AMODE 31; what remains is CP's own idea of a guest address.  Every place
# that forms or checks one gets the one test `TM VMPSW+4,X'80'` (R11 is the
# VMBLOK everywhere CP simulates a guest): a 24-bit guest's address is bits
# 8-31, a 31-bit guest's is bits 1-31.  The GADR31 macro (XAOPS) says it in
# five instructions; the three PSW gatekeepers admit bit 32 in EC mode.

# M2 step 2, part 2: CP's own PSWs carry the AMODE 31 bit.  Every path into
# CP after initialisation is an interrupt -- external, SVC, program, machine
# check, I/O, restart -- and DMKCPI installs those new PSWs from CPIPSWS, a
# table of A(mask,entry) pairs.  Bit 32 of a PSW is the addressing mode, which
# is bit 0 of the second word, so the entry address goes in as X'80' plus a
# 3-byte adcon -- the form DMKWRM uses for AL1(flags),AL3(DMKRSPPR), which the
# nucleus loader relocates as a 3-byte field with no question about a bit-0
# RLD.  SVC 8/12 need nothing: DMKSVC saves the SVC old PSW's address word in
# SAVERETN and loads it back, mode bit and all.  Dispatching a guest is LPSW
# RUNPSW with the guest's own PSW, bit 32 off, so S/370 guests stay 24-bit.
# The CPEXBLOK unstack's LPSW TEMPSAVE is AP-only (AIF (NOT &AP)); on this UP
# system the unstack is BR R15 in the current mode.  DMKCPI's own init runs
# in AMODE 24 until its first interrupt -- harmless now that part 1 made CP's
# code mode-independent, and every DMKCPI probe that points PRNPSW+4 at a
# local label (six sites) keeps working.  DMKMCH's five PSWs for the
# machine-check paths get the bit too.  The initial machine-check new PSW
# (01914000, a disabled wait) is left as it is.  I-224.

# I-229.  The trace subroutines are entered with BAL and read the caller's

# M5b.  CMS in EC mode (36-M5-CMS31.md).  Three things change and nothing
# else: (1) every PSW constant takes the EC form -- BC `channels || key AMWP`
# becomes `00000011 || key 1MWP`, so X'FF06' is X'030E', AL2(MCKM,0) is
# X'000C', and a wait is X'0E'/X'0A' in byte 1; (2) the interruption code and
# ILC are read from the fixed locations (external X'86', SVC X'89'/X'8A',
# program X'8D'/X'8E', I/O device X'BA') instead of the old PSW, which in EC
# mode carries neither; (3) every SSM mask: BC byte 0 is six channel masks,
# channels-6-plus and EXTERNAL, EC byte 0 is PER (bit 1), DAT (bit 5), I/O
# (bit 6) and external (bit 7), so X'FF' becomes X'03', X'FE' X'02', X'81'
# X'03', and the six `SSM *+1` tricks that borrowed the next opcode as a
# disable mask become an honest X'00' -- a borrowed X'58' would have set DAT.
# 133 SSM sites in 23 modules, 16 decode sites, PSW constants in 9 modules.
# Command modules (TYPE, LISTFILE, TAPE, ...) are rebuilt with CMSGEND.
# M4c / I-250: ESA/390 has no interval timer.  VM/370 CP time-slices with
# the S/370 interval timer at real X'50' (TIMER, QUANTUM, QUANTUMR); the
# hardware decremented it and an external interrupt (X'0080') ended the
# slice.  Under ESA/390 Hercules leaves X'50' alone, so a compute-bound
# virtual machine was never preempted (CPWATCH starved CMSUSER, w240/w248)
# and virtual interval timers stood still.  Emulation: DMKSCHTE decrements
# TIMER by the TOD time since its last call, in interval-timer units
# (bit 31 = 1/76800 s: TOD * 3 / 160000, remainder carried), at every CP entry that
# snapshots it (the SVC, program, I/O and external FLIHs); a value already
# negative is left alone.  DMKSCHTK, a 10 ms clock-comparator TRQBLOK set
# up by DMKCPI, guarantees those entries while a guest computes; the
# dispatcher then sees TIMER <= 0 exactly as before (VMTSEND).  DMKCPI has
# no room left (CPIATABL past its base), so DMKSCHTI's first 30-second
# sample starts the tick (DMKSCHTS).

    """DMKCPI: the ESA/390 DAT tables CP builds for ITSELF, and the CORTABLE walk.

    `DMKBLDRT` allocates and shapes the tables; this routine fills them in for
    CP's own 16 MB and marks every page locked in the CORTABLE.  It is therefore
    the second of the two modules that must be right before `LRA` can succeed --
    the rest of the conversion is other people's virtual machines.

    Five sites are flagged and six are not.  The six are the usual shape:

      * `L R3,VMSEG` with no mask, and `LA R9,0(,R9)  CLEAR TABLE LENGTH`
        which strips nothing now that STL is in the low bits (`I-128`)
      * `S R8,F4  BACK UP TO SWPTABLE POINTER` -- the same assumption
        `DMKBLD` makes twice, that `PAGSWP` sits four bytes below the page
        table (`I-130`)
      * `LA R6,16  GET NUMBER OF PAGES IN A SEGMENT FOR BCT` and
        `AL R9,F2  POINT TO NEXT PAGTABLE ENTRY` -- 256 pages, 4-byte entries
      * `ALR R2,R4  BUMP REAL PAGE ADDRESS`, where `R4` is X'10' because it is
        *also* the `BXLE` increment for a 16-byte CORTABLE entry.  One register
        served two strides that happened to agree; they no longer do.

    And one flagged site is worth reading for what it says about literals:

        NI    SEGPAGE+3,255-1 CLEAR INVALID STE BIT

    `255-1`, not `255-SEGINV`.  The rename reached it only because the same card
    names `SEGPAGE`; had the author written `3(R3)` for the field as well, this
    would have been silent in a routine whose failure mode is a CP that builds
    plausible tables and dies in `LRA`.

def corecopy():
    """STE-DESIGN step 1: the DAT table DSECTs, with every changed name CHANGED.

    The renames are the design, not cosmetics.  `STE-DESIGN.md` originally said
    this step changed nothing's behaviour -- *"nothing executes differently yet;
    this makes the symbols mean the right thing"* -- and `tools/dattab.py` showed
    that to be wrong.  CP reaches the page-table entry with **13 `LH` and 5
    `STH`** instructions, and `LH` on a fullword field is legal assembler: change
    the DSECT alone and eighteen sites read the wrong two bytes and **assemble
    clean**.  That is `I-116`'s shape with 238 lines to hide in instead of one.

    So every symbol whose meaning moves is RENAMED WITH NO ALIAS, and the
    assembler becomes the checklist: an unconverted site fails with
    `IFO188 UNDEFINED SYMBOL` instead of quietly working on the wrong bytes.
    This is `19-M1-STEP2`'s reasoning reused -- `INTTIO` was renamed to `IOSCHNO`
    with no alias precisely because *"an alias would have let all 21 references
    keep assembling and silently compare the wrong thing."*

    Renaming the containers alone would not have been enough.  Seventeen sites
    reach the flags by explicit displacement and never name the field:

        TM    1(R1),PAGINVAL TRY TO CATCH CULPRIT              DMKPTR
        TM    3(R2),SEGINV   SEGMENT OK?                       DMKCFG
        N     R10,=AL4(X'FFFFFFFF'-SEGINV) CLEAR INVALID FLAG  DMKCFG

    The last two do arithmetic on the flag VALUE in a register, so only renaming
    the flag itself reaches them.

    What is renamed, and what deliberately is not:

      `SEGPAGE`  -> `SEGPTO`    the architected name, and its byte meanings move
      `SEGPLEN`  -> `SEGPTL`    bits 0-3 -> 28-31; the VALUE is unchanged, 15 for
                                a full table, because ESA/390's PTL counts in
                                units of 16 entries and S/370's counted pages
      `SEGINV`   -> `SEGINVAL`  X'01' (bit 31, inside PTL) -> X'20' (bit 26)
      `PAGCORE`  -> `PAGPFRA`   halfword -> FULLWORD, the architected name
      `PAGINVAL` -> `PAGINV`    X'08' at +1 -> X'04' at +2 (bit 21)

      `SEGENQ`   kept.  Its one live site names `SEGPTO`, so the rename reaches
                 it, and its bit position need not move: it is read only when the
                 pointer is zero -- that is, only with `I` set -- and with `I` set
                 the hardware does not interpret bit 25.
      `PAGREF`   kept, for the same reason: all four sites name `PAGPFRA` or
                 `PAGINV`.  Its value stays X'01' and it moves to `PAGPFRA+3`,
                 where it is SAFE: **bits 24-31 of an ESA/390 PTE are ignored by
                 the hardware**, so CP's private flag needs no new home.
      `PAGTSWP`, `PAGBMP`  kept.  They are derived EQUs, so changing 16 to 256
                 propagates correctly to every user -- and any `MVC` using them
                 as a length now exceeds 256 bytes and fails loudly by itself.

    `SEGMIG` is DELETED rather than converted.  It is `X'10'`, which is the
    ESA/390 **C (common segment)** bit, and `WHAT-31BIT-NEEDS.md` lists that
    collision as undesigned item 2.  Half of that item does not exist:
    **`SEGMIG` is defined here and referenced nowhere else in the tree** -- not in
    a module, not in a COPY, not in a MACRO.  Deleting it is the honest record of
    that, and if something ever needs it the absence will say so.

# M2 step 2, part 1: the 24-bit strip sweep (I-126).  `LA Rx,0(,Ry)` clears
# bits 0-7 in AMODE 24 and only bit 0 in AMODE 31, so before CP's PSW can go
# AMODE 31 every site that uses it to drop a flag or length byte from a packed
# pointer has to say so with a mask that means the same thing in both modes:
#
#     LA Rx,0(,Rx)   ->  N  Rx,XRIGHT24          same size, sets the CC
#     LA Rx,0(,Ry)   ->  LR Rx,Ry / N Rx,XRIGHT24  +2 bytes
#
# XRIGHT24 is the PSA's X'00FFFFFF', addressable from base 0 in every module.
# This is a behaviour-preserving refactor while CP stays AMODE 24 -- which is
# how it is tested (i232) before the PSW flips (i233).  tools/strips.py is the
# inventory; it found 241 sites in 78 nucleus modules, one of them
# CC-sensitive and that one in DMKDDR, a utility.  Sites inside ranges that
# an earlier deck already replaced are skipped: those decks wrote explicit
# masks (SEGPTOM, PAGPFRM, ...) when they converted the field.  DMKLD00E is
# the loader, runs before CP in AMODE 24 and is left alone.
# Code that executes INSIDE the virtual machine is 24-bit guest code and keeps
# its LA strips: DMKLD00E (the loader) and DMKVMI, the IPL simulator CP copies
# into the guest's storage at X'20000' -- its N Rx,XRIGHT24 read the GUEST's
# page 0, not the PSA, got zero, and IPL 190 looped on an operation exception
# at virtual 6A (w104/w107, I-231).

# last held a packed word (count or flags in byte 0) then addresses storage
# above 16 MB: PRG005 in DMKPTR RSPGLOOP at AUTOLOG1's LOGOFF (i240, w109),
# `ICM R2,B'0111',PAGSHR+1` then `ICM R2,B'1111',SHRSEGCT-SHRTABLE(R2)`.
# Every ICM-3 in the nucleus whose register is not provably clean -- no
# SR/SLR/XR of it, no LA/LH/IC/SRL into it, within the previous eight
# instructions -- gets `SR Rx,Rx` in front: ICM sets the condition code the
# code then tests, so the SR changes nothing it reads.  The five it must not
# touch are listed: three where the register IS clean by a path the rule
# cannot see, and two (DMKCPS, DMKVDE) that build 'count || address' for
